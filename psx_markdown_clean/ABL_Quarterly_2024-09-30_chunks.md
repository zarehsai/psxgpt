## Chunk 6

# Economic Review

The global economy is stabilizing with a more positive outlook, as inflation, high policy rates and lingering post pandemic effects are gradually subsiding. However, geopolitical tensions may continue to weigh on these positive economic developments. In October 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has maintained its global growth forecast at 3.2% for 2024 and revised the projection to 3.2% for 2025 with slight decrease of 0.1% as compared to its previous projection made in July 2024 WEO.

Global inflation is gradually coming down; however, the slower-than-expected pace presents challenges for central banks and policymakers. Inflation in emerging markets and developing economies is expected to remain higher than in advanced economies. The IMF projected the Global inflation at 3.5% by the end of 2025, below the average level of 3.6% between 2000 and 2019.

Despite political volatility and ongoing structural challenges, Pakistan’s economy has been recovering gradually. In its recent staff report on Pakistan, the IMF noted positive developments such as easing fiscal pressure, the consistent implementation of reforms and improving financial conditions and business confidence. Based on these developments, the IMF has revised its GDP growth projection at 3.2% for FY’25 and 4.0% for FY’26, in the July 2024 World Economic Outlook. The IMF also estimates a sharp decline in domestic average inflation, from 23.4% in 2024 to 9.5% in 2025, as mentioned in its staff report on Pakistan.

The large-scale manufacturing (LSM) sector regained momentum after a period of contraction. LSM output increased by 2.4% in July 2024, compared to a contraction of 5.4% in July 2023. During this period, 14 out of 22 sectors experienced positive growth, including Textiles, Food, Beverages, Wearing Apparel, Coke and Petroleum Products, Chemicals, Automobiles and Paper & Board. Furthermore, vehicle production and sales rose by 19.5% and 16.3%, respectively, during Jul-Aug FY’25.

The agriculture sector is undergoing transition towards upgrading and innovating farming practices, thereby improving productivity. During Jul-Aug FY’25, the import of agricultural machinery and implements increased by 105.6% reaching US$ 17.6 million, compared to the same period last year.

On the external front, the current account showed significant improvement during Jul-Sep FY’25, posting a deficit of US$ 0.1 billion compared to deficit of US$ 1.2 billion in the same period last year. Additionally, the current account posted a surplus of US$ 0.1 billion in September 2024, compared to a deficit of US$ 0.2 billion in September 2023.

# Financial Review

Exports of goods and services improved during Jul-Sep FY’25, reaching US$ 9.4 billion compared to US$ 8.8 billion in the same period last year, showing a growth of 7.4%. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the commodities that registered positive growth include rice, fruits & vegetables, knitwear, bedwear, readymade garments, and chemicals & pharma products. Additionally, IT exports grew to reach at US$ 0.6 billion, up from US$ 0.4 billion last year.

During Jul-Sep FY’25, imports were recorded at US$ 16.8 billion, compared to US$ 15.0 billion during the same period last year, reflecting a growth of 12%. According to the PBS, major imports showing an upward trend include petroleum crude, liquefied natural gas, fertilizer, machinery, and iron & steel scrap.

Consequently, due to increase in imports partially offset by a surge in exports, the trade deficit stood at US$ 7.4 billion during Jul-Sep FY’25, compared to US$ 6.2 billion in the same period last year, reflecting a 19.1% increase. Workers’ remittances increased by 38.8%, reaching US$ 8.8 billion during Jul-Sep FY’25, compared to US$ 6.3 billion during the same period last year.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) registered net inflow at US$ 771.1 million during Jul-Sep FY’25, compared to US$ 520.2 million during the same period last year, marking a 48% increase. Private sector Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) recorded a net outflow of US$ 22.8 million during Jul-Sep FY’25, compared to inflow of US$ 9.6 million in the previous year. In contrast, Public FPI saw a significant net inflow of US$ 155.3 million during Jul-Sep FY’25, compared to inflow of US$ 0.2 million in the same period last year. Total Foreign Investment recorded inflow of US$ 903.5 million during Jul-Sep FY’25 as compared to inflow of US$ 530.1 million in FY’24.

Total Foreign Exchange reserves and Net reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) were recorded at US$ 15,983 million and US$ 10,702 million, respectively, as of September 27, 2024, in contrast with US$ 12,393 million and US$ 7,616 million, respectively, as of September 28, 2023.

Money supply (M2) was recorded at Rs. 36,263 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 31,525 billion as of September 30, 2023, reflecting a 15% increase. Currency in circulation (CIC) stood at Rs. 8,817 billion in September 30, 2024, up from Rs. 8,288 billion in September 30, 2023, representing a growth of 6%.

The stock market continues to trend upward, closing at 78,488 points at the end of August 2024. As of August 31, 2024, the KSE-100 index gained 601 points, while market capitalization increased by Rs. 117 billion, settling at Rs. 10,485 billion.

The US$-PKR parity has shown a slight downward trend since September 2023, appreciating by 4% to stand at Rs. 277.71 as of September 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 287.74 on September 30, 2023.

According to the SBP, inflation has decreased during the first nine months of 2024, owing to delay in implementation of planned increases in energy prices and favorable movements in global oil and energy prices. The Monetary Policy Committee of SBP decided to lower the policy rate by 200 basis points, bringing it to 17.50% in its recent meeting.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has declined sharply to 6.9% in September 2024, compared to 31.4% in September 2023. This decrease is attributed to several factors, including a drop in global oil prices, and enhanced business confidence.

Your Bank performed robustly during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Positive volumetric growth in average earning assets, supported by improving spreads and effective duration management of investments, enabled the Bank to post higher markup income of Rs. 291,215 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 264,341 million for the same period in 2023. This represents an increase of 10% or Rs. 26,874 million.

Markup/interest expense of Your Bank during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to Rs. 201,058 million, up from Rs. 183,356 million for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 10%. This rise is attributed to higher cost of deposits and increased interest on Right of use Assets, partially offset by lower borrowing expense.

Consequently, the net markup and interest income of Your Bank reached Rs. 90,157 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 80,985 million for the same period last year, showing an increase of 11%.

Fee income of Your Bank registered at Rs. 10,095 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 7,714 million as of September 30, 2023, improving by 13%. This is mainly attributable to higher card-related fee, commission on remittances, branch banking customer fee and commission on trade.

Robust growth has been observed in capital gains, which surged to reach at Rs. 1,353 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 10 million in the previous year. This increase is mainly due to higher gains on Federal government securities and Eurobonds.

Dividend income for the same period stood at Rs. 2,278 million, reflecting a decrease of 12% compared to Rs. 2,574 million as of September 30, 2023.

Foreign exchange income of Your Bank recorded at Rs. 5,447 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 5,781 million for the corresponding period in 2023, making a decrease of 6%. Other income stood at Rs. 672 million as of September 30, 2024, up from Rs. 93 million as of September 30, 2023.

As a result, non-markup income grew significantly by 23% reaching Rs. 19,845 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 16,171 million for the same period in 2023.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# (Un-audited) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024

# 3.2.1 Scope of IFRS 9 application

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 01, 2018. The requirements of this standard were already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

Upon implementation of IFRS 9, the Banking Industry sought certain technical clarifications from SBP and also identified practical difficulties in implementation of certain areas of IFRS 9. The SBP vide its Circular No.16 dated July 29, 2024 with respect to these matters has allowed temporary extension in timeline with directions to implement IFRS 9 requirements before the end of the financial year other than valuation of unquoted equity securities which is required to be implemented from next financial year. The Banking Industry continues to engage SBP on remaining matters, including fair valuation of concessional loans and treatment of foreign currency balances with SBP, in the coming months to have more clarity on such areas. Accordingly, the Bank has continued to apply previous accounting practices in such areas for the purposes of preparation of these interim financial statements.

---

## Chunk 32

# 3.2.2 Significant differences from accounting policies applicable till December 31, 2023 before adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.2.1 Classification of financial assets

IFRS 9 introduced a new classification model for financial assets that is more principle-based than the previous requirements. Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business models under which they are held. Instruments will be classified either at amortised cost, the newly established measurement category fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For equity investment that are not held for trading, an election is available to the Bank to classify these either through FVTPL or FVOCI. The previous accounting policies were based on instrument by instrument classification into Held for trading, Held to maturity and Available for Sale categories as disclosed in Note 4.3 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

---

## Chunk 33

# 3.2.2.2 Impairment of debt investments and loans and advances

The new IFRS 9 impairment requirements eliminate the previous approach for the recognition of credit losses, i.e., it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for ECLs, and updates the loss allowance for changes in these ECLs at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the holder of the financial asset needs to take into account more timely and forward-looking information in order to provide users of financial statements with meaningful information about the ECLs on financial instruments that are in the scope of these impairment requirements. The previous impairment requirements were based solely on Prudential regulations of SBP as disclosed in Note 4.4 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

---

## Chunk 34

# 3.2.2.3 Impairment of equity investments

Previously, investments classified as available for sale were required to be tested for impairment and if there is an objective evidence, impairment was required to be booked. Under IFRS 9 regime, no impairment is required against such investments which are carried at FVOCI as the gain or loss on remeasurement will permanently remain in OCI/Surplus on revaluation of Investments. The previous accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4.3 & 4.11 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

---

## Chunk 35

# 3.2.3 Material accounting policies applicable from January 01, 2024 as a result of adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.3.1 Financial assets – initial recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Bank recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# (Un-audited) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024

# 3.2.3.2 Classiﬁcation and subsequent measurement of ﬁnancial assets

Financial assets are classiﬁed into following categories for measurement subsequent to initial recognition:

- Financial assets at amortised cost
- Financial assets at ‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ FVOCI
- Financial assets at ‘fair value through proﬁt or loss’ FVTPL

---

## Chunk 37

# 3.2.3.3 Financial assets at amortised cost

The Bank classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The ﬁnancial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold ﬁnancial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- The contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on speciﬁed dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding

---

## Chunk 38

# a) Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of ﬁnancial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank’s business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- How the performance of the business model and the ﬁnancial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank’s Board/ Board Committees
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the ﬁnancial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank’s original expectations, the Bank does not change the classiﬁcation of the remaining ﬁnancial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased ﬁnancial assets going forward.

---

## Chunk 39

# b) The SPPI test

As a second step of its classiﬁcation process the Bank assesses the contractual terms of ﬁnancial asset to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. The assessment of SPPI aims to identify whether the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding’.

‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is deﬁned as the fair value of the ﬁnancial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the ﬁnancial asset. The most signiﬁcant elements of ‘interest’ within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the ﬁnancial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than trivial exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the ﬁnancial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

After initial measurement, these ﬁnancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

# 3.2.3.4 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Bank applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.

The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to profit and loss account. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss account upon derecognition of the assets.

On derecognition, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified from OCI to profit and loss account.

## Chunk 41

# 3.2.3.5 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Bank elects to classify its equity investments at FVOCI which are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable.

Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit and loss account. Dividends are recognised in profit and loss account when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

## Chunk 42

# 3.2.3.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

# 3.2.3.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities with a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits and certain items within Other Liabilities.

## Chunk 43

# 3.2.3.8 Derecognition of financial assets

# 3.2.3.8.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Bank derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Bank records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial asset is calculated as the difference between the book value (including impairment) and the proceeds received.

## Chunk 45

# 3.2.3.8.2 Derecognition other than due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Bank also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.

# 3.2.3.9 Derecognition of financial liabilities

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

# 3.2.3.10 Impairment of financial assets

# 3.2.3.10.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Bank’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Bank has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP’s instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

---

## Chunk 47

# 3.2.3.10.2 The calculation of ECLs

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial assets into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

- Stage 1: When loans are first recognized, the Bank recognizes an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR), the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
- Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs with PD set at 100%. Under SBP’s instructions, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 3 allowance would be taken as higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under Prudential Regulations.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject borrower. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in

credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank has rebutted 30 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers.

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.
- The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.
- The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories and other non-financial assets. For IFRS 9, the Bank only considers the liquid collaterals.

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted loans are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier.

Impairment losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

# 3.2.5 Impact on equity on adoption of IFRS 9

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank’s equity as at January 01, 2024 is increase in surplus on revaluation of assets of approximately Rs. 7,824.1 million and reduction in unappropriated profits of approximately Rs. 2,722.8 million. Following is the detail of the impact on respective item within equity:

- Opening unappropriated profits
- A decrease of Rs. 3,115.641 million net of tax related to impairment requirements;
- An increase of Rs. 392.841 million net of tax related to classification and measurement changes.
- Opening surplus on revaluation of assets
- An increase of Rs. 7,824.1 million net of tax related to classification and measurement changes.

# 3.2.6 Explanation of changes in classification of financial assets

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

(a) Open ended mutual funds previously classified as available for sale (AFS) has been reclassified to FVTPL. The Bank holds a portfolio of mutual funds investments which was earlier classified as available for sale (AFS) investments. However, these investments do not meet the definition of equity investment from holders perspective, therefore IFRS 9 classification requirements of debt instruments have been applied to these financial assets. The business model of this portfolio is hold to collect and sell, however contractual cash flows failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) test requirement for classification.

as FVOCI under IFRS 9. Therefore, these financial assets having a carrying value of Rs. 34.454 million have been reclassified mandatorily as FVTPL.

(b) Debt investments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) reclassified to amortised cost

‘At the date of initial application of IFRS 9, an entity shall assess the business model and the contractual terms of the financial asset on the basis of facts and circumstances that exist at the transition date. The Bank has identified certain portfolio of federal government securities under AFS category which have been held to collect the contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. As a result, financial assets having fair value amounting to Rs. 104,223.092 million have been reclassified to Amortised cost at Rs. 120,334.806 million, instead of FVOCI.

(c) Investment in debt securities previously designated at held for trading

The Bank holds investment of Rs. 20,049.848 million in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at held for trading as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVTPL category under IFRS 9.

(d) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate equity investments of Rs. 18,798.989 million in listed and unquoted securities as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. Upon disposal, the surplus or deficit of such securities previously recognized in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified from equity to Unappropriated Profit and is never recycled to Profit and Loss account.

(e) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

(i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI; and

(ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank.

# 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

The Banking Industry continues to engage SBP on remaining matters, including fair valuation of concessional loans and treatment of foreign currency balances with SBP, in the coming months to have more clarity on such areas. Accordingly, the Group has continued to apply previous accounting practices in such areas for the purposes of preparation of these interim financial statements.

# 3.2.2 Significant differences from accounting policies applicable till December 31, 2023 before adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.2.1 Classification of financial assets

IFRS 9 introduced a new classification model for financial assets that is more principle-based than the previous requirements. Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business models under which they are held. Instruments will be classified either at amortised cost, the newly established measurement category fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For equity investment that are not held for trading, an election is available to the Group to classify these either through FVTPL or FVOCI. The previous accounting policies were based on instrument by instrument classification into Held for trading, Held to maturity and Available for Sale categories as disclosed in Note 4.3 to the annual financial statements of the Group.

---

## Chunk 136

# 3.2.2.2 Impairment of debt investments and loans and advances

The new IFRS 9 impairment requirements eliminate the previous approach for the recognition of credit losses, i.e., it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for ECLs, and updates the loss allowance for changes in these ECLs at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the holder of the financial asset needs to take into account more timely and forward-looking information in order to provide users of financial statements with meaningful information about the ECLs on financial instruments that are in the scope of these impairment requirements. The previous impairment requirements were based solely on Prudential regulations of SBP as disclosed in Note 4.4 to the annual financial statements of the Group.

---

## Chunk 137

# 3.2.2.3 Impairment of equity investments

Previously, investments classified as available for sale were required to be tested for impairment and if there is an objective evidence, impairment was required to be booked. Under IFRS 9 regime, no impairment is required against such investments which are carried at FVOCI as the gain or loss on remeasurement will permanently remain in OCI/Surplus on revaluation of Investments. The previous accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4.3 & 4.11 to the annual financial statements of the Group.

## Chunk 138

# 3.2.3 Material accounting policies applicable from January 01, 2024 as a result of adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.3.1 Financial assets – initial recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Group recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

---

## Chunk 139

# 3.2.3.2 Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets

Financial assets are classified into following categories for measurement subsequent to initial recognition:

- Financial assets at amortised cost
- Financial assets at ‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ FVOCI
- Financial assets at ‘fair value through profit or loss’ FVTPL

---

## Chunk 140

# 3.2.3.3 Financial assets at amortised cost

The Group classifies its financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
---

---

## Chunk 141

# Allied Bank Limited

# Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# (Un-audited) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding

---

## Chunk 142

# a) Business model assessment

The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of
financial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Group’s business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher
level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that
business model are evaluated and reported to the Group’s Board/ Board Committees
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held
within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s
assessment

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst
case’ or ‘stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in
a way that is different from the Group’s original expectations, the Group does not change the
classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such
information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

---

## Chunk 143

# b) The SPPI test

As a second step of its classification process the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial
asset to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. The assessment of SPPI aims to identify whether
the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount
outstanding’.

‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial
recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset. The most significant elements of
‘interest’ within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money
and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Group applies judgement and considers relevant
factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which
the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than trivial exposure to risks or volatility in
the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to
contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding.
In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

After initial measurement, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

---

## Chunk 144

# 3.2.3.4 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Group applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to
changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are
recognised in the profit and loss account.

The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial
assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to
---

---

## Chunk 145

# 3rd Quarterly Report – September 2024

# Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# (Un-audited) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024

The allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to profit and loss account. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss account upon derecognition of the assets.

On derecognition, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified from OCI to profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 146

# 3.2.3.5 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Group elects to classify its equity investments at FVOCI which are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit and loss account. Dividends are recognised in profit and loss account when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

---

## Chunk 147

# 3.2.3.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

# 3.2.3.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities with a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits and certain items within Other Liabilities.

---

## Chunk 148

# 3.2.3.8 Derecognition of financial assets

# 3.2.3.8.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Group derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial asset is calculated as the difference between the book value (including impairment) and the proceeds received.

---

## Chunk 149

# 3.2.3.8.2 Derecognition other than due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The

# 3.2.3.9 Derecognition of financial liabilities

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

## Chunk 150

# 3.2.3.10 Impairment of financial assets

# 3.2.3.10.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Group’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Group has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP’s instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

---

## Chunk 151

# 3.2.3.10.2 The calculation of ECLs

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial assets into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

- Stage 1: When loans are first recognized, the Group recognizes an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR), the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
- Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Group records an allowance for the LTECLs with PD set at 100%. Under SBP’s instructions, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 3 allowance would be taken as the higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under Prudential Regulations.

The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject borrower. The Group also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Group has rebutted 30 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers.

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank.

## Chunk 152

# 3rd Quarterly Report – September 2024

# Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements

# (Un-audited) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024

has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.

The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories and other non-financial assets. For IFRS 9, the Bank only considers the liquid collaterals.

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted loans are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier.

Impairment losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the opening balance of the Bank’s equity as at January 01, 2024 is increase in surplus on revaluation of assets of approximately Rs. 7,824.1 million and reduction in unappropriated profits of approximately Rs. 2,722.8 million. Following is the detail of the impact on respective item within equity:

Opening unappropriated profits

- A decrease of Rs. 3,115.641 million net of tax related to impairment requirements;
- An increase of Rs. 392.841 million net of tax related to classification and measurement changes.

# 3.2.6 Explanation of changes in classification of financial assets

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

(a) Open ended mutual funds previously classified as available for sale (AFS) has been reclassified to FVTPL

The Bank holds a portfolio of mutual funds investments which was earlier classified as available for sale (AFS) investments. However, these investments do not meet the definition of equity investment from holders perspective, therefore IFRS 9 classification requirements of debt instruments have been applied to these financial assets. The business model of this portfolio is hold to collect and sell, however contractual cash flows failed to meet the 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI) test requirement for classification as FVOCI under IFRS 9. Therefore, these financial assets having a carrying value of Rs. 34.454 million have been reclassified mandatorily as FVTPL.

# (b) Debt investments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) reclassified to amortised cost

‘At the date of initial application of IFRS 9, an entity shall assess the business model and the contractual terms of the financial asset on the basis of facts and circumstances that exist at the transition date. The Bank has identified certain portfolio of federal government securities under AFS category which have been held to collect the contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. As a result, financial assets having fair value amounting to Rs. 104,223.092 million have been reclassified to Amortised cost at Rs. 120,334.806 million, instead of FVOCI.

## Chunk 158

# (c) Investment in debt securities previously designated at held for trading

The Bank holds investment of Rs. 20,049.848 million in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at held for trading as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVTPL category under IFRS 9.

---

## Chunk 159

# (d) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate equity investments of Rs. 18,798.989 million in listed and unquoted securities as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. Upon disposal, the surplus or deficit of such securities previously recognized in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified from equity to Unappropriated Profit and is never recycled to Profit and Loss account.

## Chunk 160

# (e) Reclassification from retired categories with no change in measurement

In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under existing local regulations were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measurement basis:

- (i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI; and
- (ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the adoption of IFRS 9 w.e.f January 01, 2024. These are disclosed in Note 4.1.

Determination of expected credit losses is a significant estimate and involves the following judgments:

- Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs
- The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis
- The Bank’s internal credit grading model based on which PDs are assigned to the individual grades
- Qualitative and quantitative indicators used as SICR triggers
- The definition of default against which parameters of ECL model such as PD, LGD and EAD are evaluated
- Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings
- Determination of economic inputs, such as GDP growth, Current Account Balance and CPI

# 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:
