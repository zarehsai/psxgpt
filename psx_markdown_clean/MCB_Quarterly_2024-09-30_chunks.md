Driven by a multi-faceted long-term strategy and concerted efforts of the management team, MCB capitalized on consistent growth in no-cost deposits and optimum management of economic capital to post an historically high nine month Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 95.110 billion; representing a growth of 8% on year-on-year basis. Profit after tax (PAT) rose to Rs. 48.5 billion, reflecting a 10% growth over the same period last year, and earnings per share (EPS) increased to Rs. 40.88.

Strong volumetric growth in average current deposits and timely repositioning within the asset book, amidst an evolving yield curve scenario, transpired into a sustained improvement in core earnings; Net interest income grew by 8%, year-on-year, to report at Rs. 115.073 billion.

Non-markup income surged by 19% to Rs. 26.9 billion, with notable contributions from fee commission income (Rs. 16.4 billion, +15%), foreign exchange income (Rs. 7.5 billion, +27%), and dividend income (Rs. 2.4 billion, +21%). In line with its strategy to diversify revenue streams, MCB saw strong growth in fee-based income across multiple channels, including a 36% increase in card-related income, 19% growth in branch banking fees and a 54% rise in investment service commissions. The Bank continues to invest in digital transformation, enhancing customer experience and improving operational efficiency; leading to a broad-based growth across digital platforms.

Despite the high inflationary environment, MCB managed operating expenses prudently, reporting an increase of 17%, with key expenditure outlays relating to staff costs, utilities, and IT-related upgrades. The Bank's cost-to-income ratio was maintained at an efficient 30.93%, ensuring strong financial discipline while continuing to invest in innovation and human capital.

Navigating a challenging operating and macroeconomic environment, the Bank has been addressing asset quality issues by maintaining discipline in management of its risk return decisions. Diversification of the loan book across customer segments and a robust credit underwriting framework that encompasses structured assessment models, effective pre-disbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has enabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk; the Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 55.1 billion as at September 30, 2024. The coverage and infection ratios of the Bank were reported at 91.98% and 7.59% respectively.

On the financial position side, total assets' base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 2.8 trillion; representing an increase of 15.1% over year end i.e. December 31, 2023. An analysis of the assets' mix highlights that net investments and gross advances increased by Rs. 258 billion (+21%) and Rs. 103 billion (+17%) respectively, over year end, and represented more than 96% of the total reported growth.

A rigorous deposit mobilization drive, focused on building no cost deposits, translated into an exceptional growth of Rs. 259 billion in Bank's total deposit base; which surpassed the 'two trillion' mark to report at Rs. 2.065 trillion (+14%) as on September 30, 2024. Current deposits increased to Rs. 978 billion (+12%) while the CASA ratio improved to 97.17% compared to 96.81% reported at year end.

Return on Assets and Return on Equity reported at 2.47% and 29.98% respectively, whereas the book value per share was reported at Rs. 189.29.

During the period under review, MCB attracted home remittance inflows of USD 3,195 million (+34%), depicting a market share of 12.5%, to further consolidate its position as an active participant in SBP's cause for improving flow of remittances into the country through banking channels.

While complying with the regulatory capital requirements, the Bank's total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) improved to 21.85% against the requirement of 11.5% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50% as reduced under the BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020). Quality of capital is evident from Bank's Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 17.15% against the requirement of 6.0%. Bank's capitalization also resulted in a Leverage Ratio of 6.17% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%. The Bank reported Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 263.11% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 153.61% against requirements of 100%.

MCB's exceptional performance and leadership in the financial sector were recognized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at the 10th Annual Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP) awards in Singapore. The Bank was honored with two prestigious accolades: 'Leading Partner Bank in Pakistan' and the 'Momentum Award – Issuing Bank', highlighting MCB's contribution to trade growth and its reliability in supporting local businesses with international trade solutions.

Further, the 'Annual Report 2023' of MCB Bank was rated 1st in the Banking Category and was also declared overall winner across all categories by the Joint Evaluation Committee of ICAP & ICMA. This award is a testament to MCB's focus on achieving excellence in governance practices and transparency in corporate reporting.

The Board of Directors has declared a 3rd interim cash dividend of Rs. 9.0 per share i.e. 90%, in addition to 180% already paid, bringing the total cash dividend for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 to 270%.

## Chunk 3

# Economic Review

The global economy is experiencing a significant shift, with major economies initiating a monetary policy easing cycle driven by lower inflation rates nearing target levels. The recent 50 basis points (bps) rate cut by the US Federal Reserve has paved the way for additional cuts, while China has introduced stimulus measures to bolster its growth in response to weak demand.

Equity markets have risen, fueled by monetary easing and strong corporate profits. Gold prices have soared with a year-to-date increase of 28.36%, primarily due to substantial purchases by Central Banks. Conversely, energy prices, particularly oil, have seen a decline due to reduced demand from major economies, notably China, and increased output projections from OPEC+ countries.

Shifting the focus to the domestic economy, Pakistan has seen positive developments, including the approval of USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility by the IMF and a USD 12 billion bilateral debt rollover from friendly nations. The country's current account has shown significant improvement, registering a surplus of USD 119 million in September 2024. This surplus is primarily attributed to increased workers' remittances and a reduction in the trade deficit. Inflation has remained in single digits since August 2024, with the latest figure at 6.9%.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has cut interest rates by 450 basis points (bps) in the calendar year 2024 so far. These rate cuts were triggered by lower inflation rates, declining global oil prices, an improved current account, and an increase in foreign exchange reserves.

## Chunk 4

# Future Outlook

Looking ahead, there are growing concerns about a global growth slowdown; reducing PMI readings in the Western markets, falling inflation, and challenges in the Chinese economy stemming from its excessive real estate debt are some indicators of this view.

Tensions in the Middle East, along with the risk of widespread conflict, are keeping oil prices relatively elevated. This situation may exert additional pressure on inflation and jeopardize Central Banks' ability to make deeper rate cuts.

In Pakistan, inflation is expected to remain low due to subdued aggregate demand. A marginal increase in commodity prices is not likely to materially increase inflation in the short term. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to make further rate cuts due to declining inflation rates and improving Balance of Payment indicators.

The IMF projects Pakistan's GDP growth of 3.2% for FY 2025; however, sustainable recovery will require political stability, structural reforms, effective monetary policy, and controlled government spending.

# 4.1

Adoption of new forms for the preparation of unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements. The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements of banks that are applicable for quarterly / half yearly periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

The Bank has adopted the above changes in the presentation and made additional disclosures to the extent applicable to its operations and corresponding figures have been rearranged / reclassified to correspond to the current period presentation, as presented in note 42.

---

## Chunk 20

# 4.2

Impact of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard introduces a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

In preparation of these financial statements, the Bank has applied requirements of IFRS 9 and instructions issued by SBP, through various circulars, from the date of initial application of January 01, 2024 with a modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Bank has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognized in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures.

The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has provided additional clarification on earlier issued 'IFRS 9 Application Instructions' to address certain key matters that had been raised by the banks with a direction to ensure compliance by extended timelines. There are a few other matters, including treatment of unencumbered general provision, which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Bank has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

---

## Chunk 21

# 4.2.1

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Bank purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

---

## Chunk 22

# a. Amortised cost (AC)

Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 23

# b. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.

---

## Chunk 24

# c. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs will be directly recorded in the profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

---

## Chunk 25

# 4.2.2

Classification and measurement. The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Bank’s business model in which financial assets are held determines whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost (AC), fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Debt based financial assets can only be held at amortized cost if these are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt based financial assets where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are measured at FVOCI, with unrealized gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognized. The debt based financial assets that are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Bank, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI in which case, both the unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the income statement.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank which are explained as follows:

---

## Chunk 26

# a. Debt based financial assets previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The application of IFRS 9 has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in INPC's, amounting to Rs. 5,699.494 million, held under AFS portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to FVTPL based on their business model assessment.

The failure of SPPI test upon assessment of contractual cash flows of debt based financial assets has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 2,950.890 million, to FVTPL.

All other debt based financial assets previously classified as AFS upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. There is no change to their measurement basis and recognition of realized and unrealized gain/loss under IFRS 9.

---

## Chunk 27

# b. Debt based financial assets previously classified as held to maturity (HTM)

Debt based financial assets currently classified as HTM upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. Investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 7,506.816 million, on failing the SPPI test have been reclassified to FVTPL.

---

## Chunk 28

# Notes to the Unconsolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (Un-audited)

# For The Nine Months Period Ended September 30, 2024

The following table reconciles the carrying value of investments in debt based financial assets as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts on transition to IFRS 9 at January 01, 2024:

---

## Chunk 29

# 4.2.3 Derecognition

Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Bank also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 30

# 4.2.4 Expected credit loss (ECL)

The Bank assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt based financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Bank recognises a credit loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

---

## Chunk 31

# c. Equity instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The Bank has elected to irrevocably designate all quoted and unquoted equity securities previously classified as available for sale (AFS) as FVOCI except units of open end mutual funds, amounting to Rs. 115.98 million, that have been mandatorily classified as measured at FVTPL. The fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Bank has reclassified impairment of Rs. 9,783.874 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 205.765 million for unlisted equity investments held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments.

The measurement category and carrying amount of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 01, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial Asset|Measurement Category|Before adoption of IFRS 9*|After adoption of IFRS 9|
|---|---|---|---|
|Federal Government Securities|Available for sale|353,834,432|353,834,432|

# The calculation of ECLs

The Bank calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

|PD|The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.|
|---|---|
|EAD|the expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.|

# 37. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of traded investments is based on quoted market prices, except for tradable securities classified by the Bank as 'amortized cost'. Quoted securities classified as amortized cost are carried at cost. Fair value of unquoted equity investments other than investments in associates and subsidiaries is determined on the basis of break up value of these investments as per the latest available audited financial statements.

Fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to absence of current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer loans and deposits, are frequently repriced.

---

## Chunk 69

# 37.1 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 2:

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Federal Government securities|The fair values of Treasury Bills and fixed rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are determined using the PKRV rates while floating rate Pakistan Investments Bonds are revalued using PKFRV rates. The fair values of foreign currency denominated GoP Eurobonds are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Term Finance and Bonds|Investments in debt securities (comprising term finance certificates, bonds and any other security issued by a company or a body corporate for the purpose of raising funds in the form of redeemable capital) are valued on the basis of the rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.|
|Foreign Government Debt Securities|The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg.|
|Foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivatives|The fair values of derivatives which are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques take into account the relevant underlying parameters including foreign currency involved, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, contracts duration etc.|
|Unlisted Shares|Breakup value determined on the basis of NAV of the company using the latest available audited financial statements.|
|Mutual Funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|
|Property and equipment (land and building) & Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets.|

The Bank's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period.

- (a) Financial instruments in Level 1 comprise of investments in listed ordinary shares.
- (b) Financial instruments in Level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Mutual Fund units, Term Finance certificates, FX Options, Cross Currency Swaps, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Exchange Contracts.
- (c) Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1

These consolidated condensed interim financial statements include the financial statements of MCB Bank Limited and its subsidiary companies and share of the profit / reserves of associates (the "Group").

a. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date when control ceases. The assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies have been consolidated on a line by line basis based on the financial statements for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and the carrying value of investments held by the parent is eliminated against the subsidiaries' shareholders' equity in these consolidated condensed interim financial statements. Material intra-Group balances and transactions have also been eliminated.

b. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, thereafter adjusted for the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the associates. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted in the carrying amount of the investment. Accounting policies of the associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The Group's share in associates have been accounted for based on the financial statements for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024.

c. Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results of operations and of net assets of subsidiary companies attributable to interests which are not owned by the Group.

## Chunk 103

# 4.1

Adoption of new forms for the preparation of consolidated condensed interim financial statements 'The SBP, vide its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 09, 2023, issued the revised forms for the preparation of consolidated condensed interim financial statements of banks that are applicable for quarterly / half yearly periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 as per BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023. The implementation of the revised forms has resulted in certain changes to the presentation and disclosures of various elements of the condensed interim financial statements. The significant change is relating to right of use assets and corresponding lease liability which are now presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position. Previously, these were presented under property and equipment (earlier titled as fixed assets) and other liabilities respectively. There is no impact of this change on the consolidated condensed interim financial statements in terms of recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities.

---

## Chunk 104

# 4.2

Impact of IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard introduces a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on an 'Expected Credit Losses' (ECL) approach rather than the 'incurred credit losses' approach as currently followed. The ECL approach has an impact on all assets of the Group which are exposed to credit risk.

In preparation of these financial statements, the Group has applied requirements of IFRS 9 and instructions issued by SBP, through various circulars, from the date of initial application of January 01, 2024 with a modified retrospective approach for restatement. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group has not restated comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognized in the opening retained earnings and other reserves at the beginning of the current year without restating the comparative figures.

The SBP through its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 dated July 29, 2024 has provided additional clarification on earlier issued 'IFRS 9 Application Instructions' to address certain key matters that had been raised by the Group's with a direction to ensure compliance by extended timelines. There are a few other matters, including treatment of unencumbered general provision, which are still under deliberation with the SBP. The Group has continued to follow the treatment adopted in respect of these matters in the prior periods till the time SBP issues the relevant guidance / clarification.

## Chunk 105

# 4.2.1

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group purchases or sells the asset. Other financial assets and liabilities like advances, lending to financial institutions, deposits etc. are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account or financial institutions. However, for cases, where funds are transferred on deferred payment basis, recognition is done when underlying asset is purchased.

- a. Amortised cost (AC) Financial assets and financial liabilities under amortised cost category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financial assets in the profit and loss account. Interest income / profit / expense on these assets / liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets and liabilities, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account.
- b. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Financial assets under FVOCI category are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in OCI. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for debt based financial assets in the profit and loss account. Interest / profit / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of debt based financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account. For equity based financial assets classified as FVOCI, capital gain / loss is transferred from surplus / deficit to unappropriated profit.
- c. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Financial assets under FVTPL category are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs will be directly recorded in the profit and loss account. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in the profit and loss account. Interest / dividend income on these assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. On derecognition of these financial assets, capital gain / loss will be recognised in the profit and loss account. An expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is not recognised for these financial assets.

## Chunk 106

# 4.2.2

Classification and measurement The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) regardless of the business model in which they are held. The Group’s business model in which financial assets are held determines whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost (AC), fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).

The business model reflects how groups of financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective. Debt based financial assets can only be held at amortized cost if these are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows (‘hold to collect’), and where those contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Assets may be sold out of ‘hold to collect’ portfolios where there is an increase in credit risk. Disposals for other reasons are permitted but such sales should be insignificant in value or infrequent in nature.

Debt based financial assets where the business model objectives are achieved by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling the assets (‘hold to collect and sell’) and that have SPPI cash flows are measured at FVOCI, with unrealized gains or losses deferred in reserves until the asset is derecognized. The debt based financial assets that are held for trading purposes are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# MCB Bank Limited & Subsidiary Companies

# Notes To The Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (Un-audited)

# For The Nine Months Period Ended September 30, 2024

The classification of equity instruments is generally measured at FVTPL unless the Group, at initial recognition, irrevocably designates as FVOCI in which case, both the unrealized and realized gains or losses are recognized in reserves and no amounts other than dividends received are recognized in the profit and loss account.

All other financial assets will mandatorily be held at FVTPL. Financial assets may be designated at FVTPL only if doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch.

The requirements of IFRS 9 Led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Group which are explained as follows:

---

## Chunk 108

# a. Debt based financial assets previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The application of IFRS 9 has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in INPC's, amounting to Rs. 5,699.494 million, held under AFS portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to FVTPL based on their business model assessment.

The failure of SPPI test upon assessment of contractual cash flows of debt based financial assets has resulted in classification and consequent remeasurement of investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 3,714.280 million, to FVTPL.

All other debt based financial assets previously classified as AFS upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as FVOCI under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, but also to sell those investment. There is no change to their measurement basis and recognition of realized and unrealized gain/loss under IFRS 9.

---

## Chunk 109

# b. Debt based financial assets previously classified as held to maturity (HTM)

Debt based financial assets currently classified as HTM upon passing the SPPI test have been designated as amortized cost under IFRS 9 as the Group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows. Investments in certain non government debt securities, amounting to Rs. 7,506.816 million, on failing the SPPI test have been reclassified to FVTPL.

The following table reconciles the carrying value of investments in debt based financial assets as reported on December 31, 2023 to the carrying amounts on transition to IFRS 9 at January 01, 2024:

# c. Equity instruments previously classified as available for sale (AFS)

The Group has elected to irrevocably designate all quoted and unquoted equity securities previously classified as available for sale (AFS) as FVOCI except units of open end mutual funds, amounting to Rs. 115.98 million, that have been mandatorily classified as measured at FVTPL.

The fair value gain or losses recognized in OCI will not be recycled to profit and loss account on derecognition of these securities.

# For The Nine Months Period Ended September 30, 2024

IFRS 9 has eliminated impairment assessment requirements for investments in equity instruments. Accordingly, the Group has reclassified impairment of Rs. 9,783.874 million on listed equity investments and Rs. 205.765 million for unlisted equity investments held as at December 31, 2023 to surplus / deficit on revaluation of investments.

The measurement category and carrying amount of financial assets in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan before and after adoption of IFRS 9 as at January 01, 2024 are compared as follows:

|Financial Asset|Measurement Category|Audited December 31, 2023|Measurement Category|IFRS 9 January 01, 2024|

# 4.2.3 Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:
- - substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or

the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

---

## Chunk 113

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the profit and loss account.

---

## Chunk 114

# 4.2.4 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ('ECL') associated with all advances and other debt based financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with letter of credit, guarantees and unutilised financing commitments hereinafter referred to as "Financial Instruments". The Group recognises a credit loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss or LTECL), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated at facility level.

The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group uses a number of qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR.

Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or interest payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations. 'Based on the level of increase in credit risk, the Group shall calculate 12mECL for assets which did not have a SICR i.e., stage 1 or a LTECL for the life of the asset (for assets which demonstrated a SICR) i.e., stage 2.

# Notes To The Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements (Un-audited)

# For The Nine Months Period Ended September 30, 2024

Based on the above process, the Group categorizers its financial instruments into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

---

## Chunk 116

# Stage 1:

When financial instruments are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 financial instruments also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and these have been reclassified from Stage 2. The 12mECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. The Bank calculates the 12mECL allowance based on the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast Exposure At Default (EAD) and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR). This calculation is made for all the scenarios.

---

## Chunk 117

# Stage 2:

When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 also includes facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the instrument has been reclassified from Stage 3. The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but PDs are applied over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash flows are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.

---

## Chunk 118

# Stage 3:

For financial instruments considered credit-impaired, the Group recognises the LTECLs for these instruments. The Group uses a PD of 100% and LGD as computed for each portfolio / segment. When a financial instrument has shown a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs.

---

## Chunk 119

# Guarantee & Letter of Credit Contracts:

The Group estimates ECLs based on the BASEL driven credit conversion factor (CCF) for guarantee and letter of credit contracts respectively. The calculation is made using a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to guarantee and letter of credit contracts are recognised within other liabilities.

# The calculation of ECLs:

The Group calculates ECLs based on a three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash flows, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:

# PD:

The probability that a counterparty will default, calibrated over the 12 months from the reporting date (stage 1) or over the lifetime of the product (stage 2) and incorporating forward looking information.

# EAD:

The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortisation, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.

---

## Chunk 120

# LGD:

It is an estimate of magnitude of loss sustained on any facility upon default by a customer. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor. It is the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Group expects to receive, including any form of collateral.

---

## Chunk 121

# Remeasurements:

The discount rate used to discount the ECLs is based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. In the absence of computation of the effective interest rate (at reporting date), the Group uses an approximation e.g. contractual rate (at reporting date).

---

## Chunk 122

# Adoption Impacts:

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 effective from January 01, 2024 with modified retrospective approach as permitted under IFRS 9. The cumulative impact of initial application of Rs. 5,206.317 million has been recorded as an adjustment to equity at the beginning of the current accounting period. The details of the impacts of initial application are tabulated below:
