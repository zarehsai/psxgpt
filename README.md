## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.16 or higher
- uv package manager
- Google Gemini API key
- LlamaParse API key (for Step 2 PDF processing - [get a free key here](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamacloud/getting_started/api_key))
- Anthropic API key (for Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration)
- Claude Desktop (optional, for MCP integration)

### API Keys and Alternatives

#### LlamaParse for PDF Processing
For Step 2 (`Step2ConvertPDFtoMarkdown.py`), you'll need a LlamaParse API key from LlamaCloud. The free tier allows processing up to 3,000 pages, which should be sufficient for initial testing. You can obtain a free API key by following the instructions [here](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamacloud/getting_started/api_key).

If you need to process more pages or prefer not to use LlamaParse, you can modify the code to use alternative open-source PDF parsers such as:
- [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF-Utilities/tree/master/pymupdf4llm)
- [Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker)
- [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured)

#### Google Gemini API
The embeddings and LLM functionality require a Google Gemini API key, which you can obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishaheen10/psxgpt.git
   cd psxgpt
   ```

2. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file with your API keys
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here" >> .env
   
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   uv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # For Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # For Mac/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   uv sync
   ```

3. Set up PostgreSQL database (for conversation persistence):
   ```bash
   # Create a new PostgreSQL database
   createdb chainlit_psx
   
   # Apply the database schema
   psql -d chainlit_psx -f chainlit_schema_psx.sql
   
   # Add database URL to your .env file
   echo "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_username@localhost:5432/chainlit_psx" >> .env
   echo "DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=postgresql://your_username@localhost:5432/chainlit_psx" >> .env
   ```
   
   **Note:** Replace `your_username` with your PostgreSQL username. If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, you can:
   - Install via Homebrew (Mac): `brew install postgresql`
   - Install via package manager (Linux): `sudo apt-get install postgresql`
   - Download from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (Windows)

4. Get your Google Gemini API key:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Navigate to the API keys section
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file

5. Generate the vector index:
   ```bash
   # Use 'python' on Windows, 'python3' on Mac/Linux
   python Step6CreateEmbeddings.py
   ```

6. Run the application (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Option 1: MCP server for Claude Desktop integration
   python Step7MCPServerPsxGPT.py
   
   # Option 2: Chainlit web interface with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   python Step8MCPClientPsxGPT.py
   ```

7. Access the web interface:
   - For Chainlit: Open your browser at http://localhost:8000

## 🔐 Default Authentication (Sample Code)

**Important:** This is sample/demo code with hardcoded authentication credentials for testing purposes.

**Default Login Credentials:**
- **Username:** `asfi@psx.com`
- **Password:** `asfi123`

These credentials are hardcoded in the application for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should:
1. Replace the hardcoded authentication with a proper user management system
2. Use environment variables or a secure database for storing user credentials
3. Implement proper password hashing and security measures
4. Set up role-based access control as needed

The current authentication is implemented in `Step8MCPClientPsxGPT.py` and can be modified according to your security requirements.

## 🌎 Using Claude Desktop with psxGPT MCP Server

The MCP server provides a seamless integration with Claude Desktop, allowing you to query PSX financial data directly within the Claude interface. What makes this integration powerful is that Claude intelligently uses the MCP tools to gather relevant context for your questions, breaking down complex queries into logical steps for data retrieval and analysis.

### Setting up Claude Desktop with psxGPT

1. Install Claude Desktop from [anthropic.com/claude/download](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/download)

2. Run the MCP server:
   ```bash
   python Step7MCPServerPsxGPT.py
   ```

3. Configure Claude Desktop:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Click on Settings (gear icon)
   - Navigate to "Developer" section
   - Click "Edit config" and add the following to your config file:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "PSX Financial Statements Server": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/your/psxChatGPT/Step7MCPServerPsxGPT.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_gemini_api_key_here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Replace `/path/to/your/psxChatGPT` with the actual path to your project
   - Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key
   - Save the config file and restart Claude Desktop

4. Once connected, you can ask Claude questions about PSX financial data, and it will use the MCP server to retrieve and analyze information.

### Example interactions with Claude Desktop

#### Basic Queries:
- "Find the unconsolidated profit and loss statement for Meezan Bank in 2023"
- "What were the total assets of HBL in their 2022 consolidated balance sheet?"
- "Compare the profit margins of MCB and UBL for 2023"

#### Advanced Analysis Queries:
- "Write an investment memo to Warren Buffet on Pakistan's banking sector with a focus on Meezan Bank and MCB"
- "Analyze the financial health of Pakistan's top 3 banks based on their Q1 2024 statements"
- "What are the key risk factors in HBL's financial statements over the past two years?"
- "Compare Islamic banks vs conventional banks in Pakistan based on their profitability and asset quality"
- "Draft a one-page summary of UBL's performance in 2023 compared to its industry peers"

### How It Works

The MCP architecture allows Claude to:

1. **Understand your query**: Claude parses your request to identify which companies, time periods, and financial statements are needed
2. **Gather relevant context**: Claude automatically calls the appropriate MCP tools to find and retrieve the most relevant financial data
3. **Analyze the information**: Using its reasoning capabilities, Claude synthesizes the data into coherent, insightful responses
4. **Present findings**: Claude formats the response according to your needs (text analysis, tables, or comparisons)

This integrated approach means you can ask increasingly sophisticated questions without needing to understand the underlying data structure or retrieval process.

### Important notes about Claude Desktop integration

- **Subscription Requirement**: Due to the context-heavy nature of financial statements, you will likely need a Claude paid subscription (Claude Pro or higher) to gather sufficient context for complex queries.
- **Alternative MCP Clients**: Any MCP-compatible client can connect to the psxGPT server, but Claude Desktop provides the easiest setup experience.
- **Server Restart**: You may need to restart the MCP server occasionally if you encounter connection issues or after system sleep/hibernation.
- **Complex Analysis**: For detailed financial analysis, the more specific your question, the better the results. Claude will progressively gather context for multi-step analyses.

## 💻 Using the Chainlit Web Interface with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
