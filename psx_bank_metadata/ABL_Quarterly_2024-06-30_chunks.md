## Chunk 6


# Economic Review

Global economy is showing signs of stabilizing after a period of slowdown in both advanced economies and emerging markets. Despite facing high policy rates, inflationary pressures, lingering post-pandemic supply chain disruptions and persistent geopolitical stress, global economic activity has started to pick up since early 2024. International Monetary Fund (IMF) has maintained its global growth forecast at 3.2%, with an expected uptick of 0.1% in 2025, revising the projection to 3.3% for the year.

Global inflation has continued to decline but at a slower pace than targeted in most advanced economies. However, inflation is expected to remain higher in emerging markets and developing economies as compared to advanced economies.

On the domestic front, the IMF projected Pakistan’s GDP at 2.0% for 2024 and 3.5% for 2025, unchanged from its previous projection made in April 2024. However, improvements in certain economic indicators such as declining inflation, a surplus in primary fiscal account, a significant reduction in current account deficit, an increase in foreign exchange reserves and successful completion of a Stand-by Agreement (SBA) program with the IMF are expected to bring the economy onto the path of recovery and stabilization.

The Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector is showing signs of recovery despite ongoing challenges, growing by 1.0% during Jul-May FY’24 compared to a contraction of 9.6% during Jul-May FY’23. In May 2024, LSM recorded a growth of 7.3% on year on year (YoY) basis. This was achieved mainly due to performance in wearing apparel, pharma, coke & petroleum products, fertilizers and furniture sectors.

The agriculture credit experienced substantial growth in FY’24, with credit disbursements totalling Rs. 1,973 billion during Jul-May FY’24, marking a 26.0% increase compared to the previous year.

The current account showed significant improvements during FY’24. The current account deficit reduced to US$ 0.7 billion as on June 30, 2024 FY’24, compared to US$ 3.3 billion as on June 30, 2023, shrinking by 79%.

On the external front, imports of goods and services increased by 3%, reaching US$ 63 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, compared to US$ 61 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

Exports of goods and services stood at US$ 39 billion during FY’24, compared to US$ 35 billion during FY’23, an improvement of 10%. According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), commodities that registered significant positive growth include Rice, Fruits, Cotton yarn, and Plastic materials. On YoY basis, exports of goods and services showed healthy growth of 14%, reaching US$ 3.1 billion in June 2024, compared to US$ 2.7 billion in June 23.

This led to a 6% reduction in trade deficit, which stood at US$ 24 billion at the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2024, compared to US$ 26 billion at the end of last fiscal year on June 30, 2023.

During FY’24, workers’ remittances were registered at US$ 30 billion, compared to US$ 27 billion during FY’23.

As a result, overall budget deficit stood at Rs. 7,207 billion for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to Rs. 6,521 billion for the year ended June 30, 2023, an increase of 11%.

The Stock Market continued its upward trend from September 2023 through June 2024. The KSE 100 index closed at 78,445 points at the end of June 2024 and Market capitalization of PSX stood at Rs. 10,375 billion as on June 30, 2024.

The US$-PKR exchange rate of 9% has shown a downward trend since August 2023, appreciating by 9% and maintaining a stable trend since April 2024 to reach at Rs. 278.34 as on June 30, 2024.

Improvements in the external account, an increase in foreign exchange reserves, relatively lower inflation and PKR vs USD parity have influenced the Policy rate. Accordingly, the State Bank of Pakistan has reduced the policy rate to 19.50% in July 2024 which was continuing at 22% since June 2023.

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed interim unconsolidated statement of financial position of Allied Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as at 30 June 2024, and the related condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of changes in equity, and condensed interim unconsolidated statement of cash flows, and notes to the condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements for the six-month period then ended (here-in-after referred to as the “Condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements”).

# Scope of review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”. A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Other matter

The figures for the condensed interim unconsolidated profit and loss account and condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income for the three months period ended 30 June 2024 and 2023 have not been reviewed by us and we do not express a conclusion on them, as we are required to review only the cumulative figures for the six-month period ended 30 June 2024.

In terms of the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, adjustments to the carrying amounts of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening unappropriated proﬁt and surplus on revaluation of assets - net of tax at the beginning of the current period without restating the comparative ﬁgures. The impact on carrying amounts of the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 3.2.4.

# 3.2.1 Scope of IFRS 9 application

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 01, 2018. The requirements of this standard were already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted.

Upon implementation of IFRS 9, the Banking Industry sought certain technical clarifications from SBP and also identified practical difficulties in implementation of certain areas of IFRS 9. The SBP vide its Circular No.16 dated July 29, 2024 with respect to these matters has allowed temporary extension in timeline with directions to implement IFRS 9 requirements before the end of the financial year other than valuation of unquoted equity securities which is required to be implemented from next financial year. The Banking Industry continues to engage SBP on remaining matters, including fair valuation of concessional loans and treatment of foreign currency balances with SBP, in the coming months to have more clarity on such areas. Accordingly, the Bank has continued to apply previous accounting practices in such areas for the purposes of preparation of these interim financial statements.

# 3.2.2 Significant differences from accounting policies applicable till December 31, 2023 before adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.2.1 Classification of financial assets

IFRS 9 introduced a new classification model for financial assets that is more principle-based than the previous requirements. Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business models under which they are held. Instruments will be classified either at amortised cost, the newly established measurement category fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For equity investment that are not held for trading, an election is available to the Bank to classify these either through FVTPL or FVOCI. The previous accounting policies were based on instrument by instrument classification into Held for trading, Held to maturity and Available for Sale categories as disclosed in Note 4.3 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

# 3.2.2.2 Impairment of debt investments and loans and advances

The new IFRS 9 impairment requirements eliminate the previous approach for the recognition of credit losses, i.e., it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for ECLs, and updates the loss allowance for changes in these ECLs at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the holder of the financial asset needs to take into account more timely and forward-looking information in order to provide users of financial statements with meaningful information about the ECLs on financial instruments that are in the scope of these impairment requirements. The previous impairment requirements were based solely on Prudential regulations of SBP as disclosed in Note 4.4 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

## Chunk 39


# 3.2.2.3 Impairment of equity investments

Previously, investments classified as available for sale were required to be tested for impairment and if there is an objective evidence, impairment was required to be booked. Under IFRS 9 regime, no impairment is required against such investments which are carried at FVOCI as the gain or loss on remeasurement will permanently remain in OCI/Surplus on revaluation of Investments. The previous accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4.3 & 4.11 to the annual financial statements of the Bank.

# 3.2.3 Material accounting policies applicable from January 01, 2024 as a result of adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.3.1 Financial assets – initial recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Bank recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

- The ﬁnancial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold ﬁnancial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- The contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on speciﬁed dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding

## Chunk 43


# a) Business model assessment

The Bank determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of ﬁnancial assets to achieve its business objective.

The Bank’s business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:

- How the performance of the business model and the ﬁnancial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Bank’s Board/ Board Committees
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the ﬁnancial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Bank’s assessment

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Bank’s original expectations, the Bank does not change the classiﬁcation of the remaining ﬁnancial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased ﬁnancial assets going forward.

As a second step of its classiﬁcation process the Bank assesses the contractual terms of ﬁnancial asset to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. The assessment of SPPI aims to identify whether the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding’.

‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is deﬁned as the fair value of the ﬁnancial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the ﬁnancial asset. The most signiﬁcant elements of ‘interest’ within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the ﬁnancial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than trivial exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the ﬁnancial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

After initial measurement, these ﬁnancial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

# 3.2.3.4 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Bank applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.

The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to profit and loss account. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss account upon derecognition of the assets.

On derecognition, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified from OCI to profit and loss account.

# 3.2.3.5 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Bank elects to classify its equity investments at FVOCI which are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable.

Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit and loss account. Dividends are recognised in profit and loss account when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

# 3.2.3.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

# 3.2.3.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities with a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits and certain items within Other Liabilities.

The Bank derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Bank records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial asset is calculated as the difference between the book value (including impairment) and the proceeds received.

# 3.2.3.8.2 Derecognition other than due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Bank also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.

# 3.2.3.10 Impairment of financial assets

# 3.2.3.10.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Bank’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Bank has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortized cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP’s instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

# 3.2.3.10.2 The calculation of ECLs

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial assets into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

- Stage 1: When loans are first recognized, the Bank recognizes an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR), the Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
- Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Bank records an allowance for the LTECLs with PD set at 100%. Under SBP’s instructions, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 3 allowance would be taken as higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under Prudential Regulations.

The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Bank considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject borrower. The Bank also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in

credit grades, generally, the Bank considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Bank has rebutted 30 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers.

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.
- The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.
- The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories and other non-financial assets. For IFRS 9, the Bank only considers the liquid collaterals.

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted loans are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier.

Impairment losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

(a) Open ended mutual funds previously classified as available for sale (AFS) has been reclassified to FVTPL. The Bank holds a portfolio of mutual funds investments which was earlier classified as available for sale (AFS) investments. However, upon implementation of IFRS 9, the Bank has elected to measure the investments as FVTPL reclassifying from available for sale which is permitted under IFRS 9. Therefore, these financial assets having a carrying value of Rs. 34.454 million have been reclassified.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the adoption of IFRS 9 w.e.f January 01, 2024. These are disclosed in Note 4.1.

# 4.1 Impairment losses on financial assets

Determination of expected credit losses is a significant estimate and involves the following judgments:

- Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs
- The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis
- The Bank’s internal credit grading model based on which PDs are assigned to the individual grades
- Qualitative and quantitative indicators used as SICR triggers
- The definition of default against which parameters of ECL model such as PD, LGD and EAD are evaluated
- Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings
- Determination of economic inputs, such as GDP growth, Current Account Balance and CPI

# 25.3.2 Income tax assessments

The income tax assessments of the Bank have been finalized up to and including tax year 2023 for local, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan operations. While finalizing income tax assessments up to tax year 2023 income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 35,086 million (2023: 34,841 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Bank before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Bank and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references no provision has been made by the Bank on aggregate sum of Rs. 35,086 million (2023: 34,841 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Bank.

Tax Authorities have conducted proceedings of withholding tax audit under section 161/205 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax year 2003 to 2006 and tax year 2008 to 2019 and tax year 2022 created an arbitrary demand of Rs. 2,029 million (2023: 2,029 million). The Bank’s appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that these appeals will be decided in favor of the Bank; therefore, no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 2,029 million (2023: 2,029 million).

Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Act, 2005/Sales Tax Act/Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act, 2011 for the year 2008 to 2017 thereby creating arbitrary aggregate demand of Rs. 1,144 million (2023: 1,144 million). The Bank’s appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs. 1,144 million (2023: 1,144 million).

The Honorable High Court granted relief to the Bank by way of interim orders. Meanwhile, along with other banks, Bank filed a further CP whereby vires of section 23C of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, 1947 was sought to be declared ultra vires. On November 8, 2018, the Honorable court was pleased to order that the Appellate Board shall not finally decide the appeals. Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated January 15, 2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank. Based on merits of the appeals, the management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.

# 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:

# 3.1 Changes in reporting format

The SBP vide BPRD Circular No. 2 dated February 09, 2023 specified the new format for interim financial statements of banking companies. The new format has revised the disclosure requirements of the Group for the half year ended June 30, 2024 which has resulted in additional disclosures relating to IFRS 9 and reclassification of Lease liabilities and Right of use assets on the face of Statement of Financial Position out of Property and equipment and Other Liabilities, respectively in these financial statements.

# 3.2 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 (read with IFRS 9 application instructions issued by SBP) using modified retrospective approach with date of initial application as January 01, 2024, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. In terms of the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening unappropriated profit and surplus on revaluation of assets - net of tax at the beginning of the current period without restating the comparative figures. The impact on carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 3.2.4.

# 3.2.1 Scope of IFRS 9 application

IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 01, 2018. The requirements of this standard were already incorporated in the Group’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. Upon implementation of IFRS 9, the Banking Industry sought certain technical clarifications from SBP and also identified practical difficulties in implementation of certain areas of IFRS 9. The SBP vide its Circular No.16 dated July 29, 2024 with respect to these matters has allowed temporary extension in timeline with directions to implement IFRS 9 requirements before the end of the financial year other than valuation of unquoted equity securities which is required to be implemented from next financial year. The Banking Industry continues to engage SBP on remaining matters, including fair valuation of concessional loans and treatment of foreign currency balances with SBP, in the coming months to have more clarity on such areas. Accordingly, the Group has continued to apply previous accounting practices in such areas for the purposes of preparation of these interim financial statements.

# 3.2.2 Significant differences from accounting policies applicable till December 31, 2023 before adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.2.1 Classification of financial assets

IFRS 9 introduced a new classification model for financial assets that is more principle-based than the previous requirements. Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business models under which they are held. Instruments will be classified either at amortised cost, the newly established measurement category fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For equity investment that are not held for trading, an election is available to the Group to classify these either through FVTPL or FVOCI. The previous accounting policies were based on instrument by instrument classification into Held for trading, Held to maturity and Available for Sale categories as disclosed in Note 4.3 to the annual financial statements of the Group.

# 3.2.2.2 Impairment of debt investments and loans and advances

The new IFRS 9 impairment requirements eliminate the previous approach for the recognition of credit losses, i.e., it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for ECLs, and updates the loss allowance for changes in these ECLs at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. Consequently, the holder of the financial asset needs to take into account more timely and forward-looking information in order to provide users of financial statements with meaningful information about the ECLs on financial instruments that are in the scope of these impairment requirements. The previous impairment requirements were based solely on Prudential regulations of SBP as disclosed in Note 4.4 to the annual financial statements of the Group.

# 3.2.2.3 Impairment of equity investments

Previously, investments classified as available for sale were required to be tested for impairment and if there is an objective evidence, impairment was required to be booked. Under IFRS 9 regime, no impairment is required against such investments which are carried at FVOCI as the gain or loss on remeasurement will permanently remain in OCI/Surplus on revaluation of Investments. The previous accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4.3 & 4.11 to the annual financial statements of the Group.

# 3.2.3 Material accounting policies applicable from January 01, 2024 as a result of adoption of IFRS 9

# 3.2.3.1 Financial assets – initial recognition

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Group recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value in profit and loss account. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit and loss account when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

# a) Business model assessment

The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of
financial assets to achieve its business objective. The Group’s business model is not assessed on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable
factors such as:

- How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Group’s Board/ Board Committees
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed
- The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’ or
‘stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is
different from the Group’s original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the
remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing
newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.

## Chunk 155


# b) The SPPI test

As a second step of its classification process the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial asset to
identify whether they meet the SPPI test. The assessment of SPPI aims to identify whether the contractual
cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding’.

‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial
recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset. The most significant elements of
‘interest’ within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and
credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Group applies judgement and considers relevant factors
such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest
rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than trivial exposure to risks or volatility in the
contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases,
the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

After initial measurement, these financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

# 3.2.3.4 Debt instruments at FVOCI

The Group applies this new category under IFRS 9 when both of the following conditions are met:

- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
- The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test

FVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to
changes in fair value recognised in OCI. Interest income at EIR and foreign exchange gains and losses are
recognised in the profit and loss account.

The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial
assets in the statement of financial position, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to

The allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to profit and loss account. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss account upon derecognition of the assets.

On derecognition, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified from OCI to profit and loss account.

# 3.2.3.5 Equity instruments at FVOCI

Upon initial recognition, the Group elects to classify its equity investments at FVOCI which are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit and loss account. Dividends are recognised in profit and loss account when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.

# 3.2.3.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial assets and financial liabilities in this category are those that are:

- held for trading, that is, they have been purchased or issued primarily for short-term profit-making through trading activities or form part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together, for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit taking, or
- not held for trading and have been either designated by management upon initial recognition, or mandatorily required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9

Financial assets are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit and loss account. Interest and dividend income or expense is recorded in net trading income according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to payment has been established.

# 3.2.3.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost

Financial liabilities with a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. These include Bills payable, Borrowings, Deposits and certain items within Other Liabilities.

# 3.2.3.8 Derecognition of financial assets

# 3.2.3.8.1 Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Group derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loan is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless it is deemed to be purchased originated credit impaired.

If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group records a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial asset is calculated as the difference between the book value (including impairment) and the proceeds received.

# 3.2.3.10 Impairment of financial assets

# 3.2.3.10.1 Overview of the ECL principles

The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Group’s loan loss impairment method by replacing the incurred loss approach of the local regulations with a forward-looking ECL approach. The Group has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets held at amortized cost or FVOCI, together with loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. Under the SBP’s instructions, local currency credit exposures guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of ECL.

## Chunk 163


# 3.2.3.10.2 The calculation of ECLs

The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit loss (LTECL)), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL). The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Based on the above process, the Bank groups its financial assets into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:

- Stage 1: When loans are first recognized, the Group recognizes an allowance based on 12mECLs. Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR), the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 3.
- Stage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Group records an allowance for the LTECLs with PD set at 100%. Under SBP’s instructions, until implementation of IFRS 9 has stabilized, Stage 3 allowance would be taken as the higher of IFRS 9 ECL or provision computed under Prudential Regulations.

The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group considers an exposure to have significantly increased in credit risk when there is considerable deterioration in the internal rating grade for subject borrower. The Group also applies a secondary qualitative method for triggering a significant increase in credit risk for an asset, such as moving a customer/facility to the watch list, or the account becoming forborne. Regardless of the change in credit grades, generally, the Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. However, for certain portfolios, the Group has rebutted 30 DPD presumption based on behavioural analysis of its borrowers.

The key elements of ECL calculations are as follows:

- The Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. PD is estimated based on transitioning among credit states. Credit states are defined by rating classes and are based on the Bank’s internal risk ratings (i.e. from 1 to 12). Through the yearly review of the non-consumer portfolio, the Bank

has drawn a yearly transition matrix of ratings to compute a count based PD over the one year horizon for the last 7 years. PDs for Non rated portfolios are calculated based on Days Past Due (DPD) bucket level for each segment separately. Where practical, they also build on information from External Rating Agencies. PDs are then adjusted for IFRS 9 ECL calculations to incorporate forward looking information.

The Exposure at Default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.

The Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various forms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories and other non-financial assets. For IFRS 9, the Bank only considers the liquid collaterals.

The interest rate used to discount the ECLs would be based on the effective interest rate that is expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities.

When estimating the ECLs, the Bank considers three probability-weighted scenarios (a base case, a best case, and a worse case). Each of these is associated with different PDs, EADs and LGDs. These expected probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. This calculation is made for each of the three scenarios. When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how defaulted loans are expected to be recovered, including the probability that the loans will cure and the value of collateral or the amount that might be received for selling the asset.

The maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier.

Impairment losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset’s gross carrying value.

# 3.2.6 Explanation of changes in classification of financial assets

The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Bank as shown in the table above:

1. Open ended mutual funds previously classified as available for sale (AFS) has been reclassified to FVTPL.

The Bank holds a portfolio of mutual funds investments which was earlier classified as available for sale (AFS) investments. However, upon implementation of IFRS 9, the Bank has elected to measure the investments as FVTPL reclassifying from available for sale which is permitted under IFRS 9. Therefore, these financial assets having a carrying value of Rs. 34.454 million have been reclassified.
2. Debt investments previously classified as available for sale (AFS) reclassified to amortized cost.

At the date of initial application of IFRS 9, an entity shall assess the business model and the contractual terms of the financial asset on the basis of facts and circumstances that exist at the transition date. The Bank has identified certain portfolio of federal government securities under AFS category which have been held to collect the contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on.

# 4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of these unconsolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the application of its accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The significant judgments made by management in applying its accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the adoption of IFRS 9 w.e.f January 01, 2024. These are disclosed in Note 4.1.

# 4.1 Impairment losses on financial assets

Determination of expected credit losses is a significant estimate and involves the following judgments:

- Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs
- The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis
- The Bank’s internal credit grading model based on which PDs are assigned to the individual grades
- Qualitative and quantitative indicators used as SICR triggers
- The definition of default against which parameters of ECL model such as PD, LGD and EAD are evaluated
- Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings
- Determination of economic inputs, such as GDP growth, Current Account Balance and CPI

While finalizing income tax assessments up to tax year 2023, income tax authorities made certain add backs with aggregate tax impact of Rs. 35,111 million (2023: Rs.34,866 million). As a result of appeals filed by the Group before appellate authorities, most of the add backs have been deleted. However, the Group and Tax Department are in appeals/references before higher forums against unfavorable decisions. Pending finalization of appeals/references no provision has been made by the Group on aggregate sum of Rs.35,111 million (2023: Rs.34,866 million). The management is confident that the outcome of these appeals/references will be in favor of the Group.| | |
|Tax Authorities have conducted proceedings of withholding tax audit under section 161/205 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for tax year 2003 to 2006 and tax year 2008 to 2018 and created an arbitrary demand of Rs.2,049 million (2023: Rs.2,049 million). The Group's appeals before CIR(A)/Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that these appeals will be decided in favor of the Group; therefore, no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs.2,049 million (2023: Rs.2,049 million).| | | |
|Tax authorities have also issued orders under Federal Excise Act, 2005 / Sales Tax Act, 1990, Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 and Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act, 2011 for the year 2008 to 2017 and 2021 thereby creating arbitrary aggregate demand of Rs.1,149 million (2023: Rs.1,144 million). The Group's appeals before CIR(A) / Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) are pending for adjudication. The management is confident that aforesaid demand will be deleted by appellate authorities and therefore no provision has been made against the said demand of Rs.1,149 million (2023: Rs.1,144 million).| | | |

Meanwhile, along with other banks, Bank filed a further CP whereby vires of section 23C of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, 1947 was sought to be declared ultra vires. On November 8, 2018, the Honorable court was pleased to order that the Appellate Board shall not finally decide the appeals. Subsequently, the earlier CP was disposed of vide order dated January 15, 2019 with a direction to the Appellate Board to first decide the stay application of the Bank and till then, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Department has been restrained from taking any coercive action against the Bank. Based on merits of the appeals, the management is confident that these appeals shall be decided in favor of the Bank and therefore no provision has been made against the impugned penalty.| | |

# 37 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# 37.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial instruments included in level 1 comprise of investments in Listed Ordinary Shares.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments included in level 2 comprise of Sukuk Bonds, Units of Mutual Funds, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Market Treasury Bills, Term Finance Certificates and Forward Government & Exchange Contracts.
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). Currently, no financial instruments are classified in level 3.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised:
