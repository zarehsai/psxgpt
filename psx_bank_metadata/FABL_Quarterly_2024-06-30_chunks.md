# Economic Update

Pakistan’s economy embarked on a stabilization phase in FY2024, demonstrating resilience and steady improvement across various sectors. The government's dedicated efforts to complete the 2023 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF have yielded significant progress in restoring economic stability, reducing external pressures and led to a moderate real GDP growth rate of 2.38%.

The agricultural sector has been a key driver of growth, expanding by 6.25% in 2023-24, compared to 2.27% in the previous year. This growth is attributed to favorable weather conditions increasing the crop yields. Wheat, cotton, and rice production have seen significant increases.

The Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector has also shown signs of recovery, moving marginally into positive territory with a growth of 0.99% during July-May FY2024. This improvement is attributed to stimulated external demand, improved business confidence, and the removal of import restrictions.

Inflation, although still high, has significantly reduced from its peak of 38% in May 2023 to 12.6% in June 2024. This decline is attributed to a coordinated policy response, including fiscal consolidation, smooth supplies of food items, favorable global commodity prices, and the base effect.

# The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Monetary Policy Update

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has started easing monetary policy, reducing the policy rate further by 100 bps to 19.50% in the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held on 29th July 2024. This reduction makes a total decrease of 250 bps in 2024 aimed at boosting the economy. However, fiscal policy continues to grapple with the legacy of persistently high fiscal deficits and debt, resulting from unprecedented expenditures and moderate growth in revenues.

The stock market has witnessed a significant boom, with the KSE-100 index rising to 78,444 points at the end of June 2024. This surge in confidence reflects investors' trust in the Pakistan Stock Exchange, largely due to the successful implementation of the IMF's program under the SBA, the encouraging performance of the external sector, and the formation of a new political government.

The external economic landscape has also shown signs of improvement, with the current account deficit substantially contained, decreasing by 87.6% to US $0.467 billion compared to US $3.7 billion in the preceding year. This reduction is primarily due to a rise in exports and a continued decline in imports. Remittances have also increased, reaching US $30.25 billion during July-June FY2024.

To ensure a stable trajectory, it is crucial to maintain the policy and reforms being undertaken by the government. Securing the new IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of approximately US $7 billion is also essential for sustained external inflows and to meet the growing financing needs of the economy.

# Profit & Loss Account

|Rs. in million|June ‘24|June ‘23|Growth %|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total Revenue|47,114|35,411|33.0|
|Total Expenses|(22,089)|(18,030)|22.5|
|Profit before tax and provisions|25,025|17,381|44.0|
|Net provisions|801|(2,325)|134.5|
|Profit before tax|25,826|15,056|71.5|
|Tax|(12,560)|(7,531)|66.8|
|Profit after tax|13,266|7,525|76.3|
|Earnings per share (Rupees)|8.74|4.96|76.3|

In H1'24, FBL continued its trajectory of success and achieved remarkable financial performance, recording unprecedented growth despite challenges posed by the prevailing economic conditions. On a standalone basis, Profit Before Tax (PBT) increased by 71.5% to PKR 25.8 billion. FBL has achieved a Profit After Tax (PAT) of PKR 13.3 billion, 76.3% higher than PKR 7.5 billion in the corresponding period last year, with Earnings Per Share increasing from PKR 4.96 to PKR 8.74.

The Bank, continuing its growth trajectory, increased total revenue by 33.0% over H1’23 to PKR 47.1 billion. This growth was fueled by a combination of balance sheet expansion (H1’24 vs H1’23) and an uptick in spreads, resulting in a 24.4% YoY increase in net spread earned, taking it to PKR 38.2 billion in H1’24. Healthy growth in current deposits of PKR 52 billion (15.7%) YoY and increase in average benchmark rate helped to improve the overall spreads.

Non-fund income grew by 90.0% compared to the corresponding period last year and was at PKR 8.9 billion in H1’24. Fee income also saw an uptick of 23.6%, to PKR 5.1 billion, with significant contributions from trade and remittance business solidifying the Bank’s foothold in these key businesses. Trade and remittance volumes registered an exponential increase compared to the corresponding period last year. Consequently, FX income showed strong momentum, growing by 66.2%, to PKR 2.8 billion. The Bank also experienced a positive swing of PKR 2.3 billion YoY in capital gains, benefiting from the positive trajectory of the PSX.

Due to double digit inflation, pressure on PKR / USD parity, and an expanding branch network, the bank's total expenses have risen by 22.5% over H1'23. However, the cost to income ratio has improved from 50.9% in H1’23 to 46.9% in H1’24. There is a net reversal in provisions for H1’24 of PKR 0.8 billion, compared to a charge of PKR 2.3 billion in H1’23. The NPL ratio is at 3.8% with total coverage at 117.3%.

FBL’s total assets continued to grow, reaching PKR 1.4 trillion, driven by strong deposit mobilization and increase in borrowings from financial institutions. The upward trend in Current Accounts seen over past few years continued, taking them to PKR 381 billion i.e., 16.8% growth over December 2023. Total deposits also increased by 5.5% over December 2023 and were at PKR 1.1 trillion. The Current Account (CA) mix improved to 35.5% from 32.1% in December 2023 and CASA mix improved to 78.7% from 75.0% in December 2023.

FBL’s net financing marginally reduced due to the impact of IFRS9 implementation and stood at PKR 575 billion. However, gross financing increased by PKR 1.5 billion. Advance Deposit Ratio (ADR) reduced from 57.0% in December 2023 to 53.6% in June 2024. The liquidity generated was placed in investments which increased by 5.8% reaching PKR 624 billion.

The Bank remained committed in achieving the given targets and creating sustainable value for all stakeholders. With a strong foundation and a focus on growth, we are confident in our ability to In Sha Allah, scale new heights in future.

# 14 Half Year June 30, 2024

# Independent Auditor’s Review Report

# To the members of Faysal Bank Limited

# On review of Condensed Interim Unconsolidated Financial Statements

# Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed interim unconsolidated statement of financial position of Faysal Bank Limited ("the Bank") as at 30 June 2024 and the related condensed interim unconsolidated statement of profit and loss account and condensed interim unconsolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed interim unconsolidated statement of changes in equity, and condensed interim unconsolidated cash flow statement and notes to the condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements for the half year then ended (here-in-after referred to as the "interim financial statements"). Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.

## Chunk 21


# Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

# Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan for interim financial reporting.

# 4.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Bank. To ensure smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks, SBP had previously issued detailed instructions in BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at January 1, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

The accounting policies applicable to the 2023 presented information is consistent with the policies mentioned in the annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

SBP wide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024 have made certain amendments and extended timelines of application instructions for certain areas where the banking industry has sought more time. These amendments and relaxations include modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per the standard and recording and treatment of staff financing and other financings given at reduced rates with effect from October 1, 2024. Further, the banks have been asked to use existing practices of recordings of profit/return income using effective yield rate and ensure full recognition from October 1, 2024, this in turn also effects the reduced rate financing and modified assets accounting. Moreover, SBP have allowed an extension to Banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating EAD for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition the banks have also been allowed to continue existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investment at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till December 31, 2024 and perform fair valuation of these securities afterwards.

# 4.1.1 Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital.

Had IFRS 9 not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 12 bps from 18.85% to 18.97%. The Bank has applied the transitional arrangement on Regulatory Capital. Had the transitional arrangement not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 9 bps from 18.85% to 18.94%. In June 2024, ECL for Stage 1 and Stage 2 decreased due to which IFRS 9 transitional benefit has been compromised. The Bank has applied the transitional arrangement on Regulatory Capital. Had the transitional arrangement not been applied than Leverage Ratio would have been lower by 18 bps from 4.97% to 4.79%.

# 4.1.2 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# Recognition / derecognition and initial measurement

Trade receivable and debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price.

The policy for derecognition of financial assets and liabilities are consistent with the annual unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## Chunk 46


# Classification of Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortized cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective yield rate method. Profit expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit and loss.

# 4.1.3 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, historical sales information etc.

# 4.1.4 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

The Bank assesses whether the contractual cash flows of a financial asset meet the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criterion by examining the contractual terms. This includes checking for terms that could alter the amount and timings of cash flows, such as contingent events, leverage, or prepayment features, etc.

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

For fixed-rate financings with periodic profit rate resets, the Bank considers these SPPI-compliant as the revised rates reflect time value, credit risk, and other associated risks.

# 4.1.5 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVTPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any profit / markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective yield method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Profit and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Profit income is calculated using the effective yield method and includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discount and impairment are recognised in profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit and loss account.|
|Equity investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.|

# 4.1.6 Modification

Financial assets

The Bank renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, the Bank derecognizes the original asset and recognizes a new financial asset at fair value, plus any eligible transaction costs.

If a financial asset measured at amortized cost or FVOCI is modified but not derecognized, the bank recalculates its gross carrying amount using the original effective yield rate, with the adjustment recognized as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss.

Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. If the new cash flows are significantly different, the bank derecognizes the old liability and recognizes a new one at fair value, with the difference between the old carrying amount and new fair value recorded in profit and loss.

# 4.1.7  Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (‘12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in ‘Stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage 3'. Under the SBP’s instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive, including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

Under SBP's instructions, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for Corporate / Commercial / SME financing and at a segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

# 4.1.8  Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR. Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and pending litigations.

A financial asset is transitioned to a backward stage in line with SBP instructions.

# 4.1.9  Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring multiple functions to effectively work together to ensure input from all business lines. The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on bank's capital.

The Bank’s Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assess the financial impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios.

As per the Bank's policy, the Bank’s Internal Audit function carries out periodic review of IFRS 9 methodology and impacts calculated by the Management.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) through its BPRD Circular No. 02 dated February 9, 2023 and BPRD Circular Letter No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023 has amended the format of quarterly and half yearly financial statements of banks. All banks are directed to prepare their quarterly and half yearly financial statements on the revised format effective from accounting year starting from January 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Bank has prepared these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements on the new format prescribed by the SBP.

The adoption of revised format has resulted in following significant changes:

- Right-of-use-assets (note 14) amounting to Rs 10,882.285 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 10,713.046 million) which were previously shown as part of fixed assets are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.
- Lease liabilities (note 20) amounting to Rs 13,348.373 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 12,868.103 million) which were previously shown as part of other liabilities (note 22) are now shown separately on the unconsolidated statement of financial position.

| |The department and the Bank has disagreement on a matter relating to taxability of gain on bargain purchase on the acquisition of ex-RBS Pakistan. The additional tax liability on the matter amounts to Rs. 1,154.701 million (December 31, 2023: Rs. 1,154.701 million). The Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] had deleted the said additional tax liability, however the income tax department had filed an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) against the order of CIR(A). During the current period, the ATIR passed an order and maintained the decision of the CIR(A) in favour of the Bank that gain on bargain purchase is not taxable. Subsequently, the department has challenged the order in Honorable High Court of Sindh. However, the management of the Bank is confident that the matter will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly, no provision has been recorded in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements in respect of this matter.| |
|24.4|There are certain claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debt amounting to Rs 33,625.155 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 29,647.217 million). These mainly represent counter claims filed by the borrowers for restricting the Bank from disposal of assets (such as mortgaged / pledged assets kept as security), cases where the Bank was proforma defendant for defending its interest in the underlying collateral kept by it at the time of financing, certain cases filed by ex-employees of the Bank for damages sustained by them consequent to the termination from the Bank's employment and cases for damages towards opportunity losses suffered by the customers due to non-disbursements of running finance facility as per the agreed terms. The above also includes an amount of Rs 25,299.030 million (December 31, 2023: Rs 25,299.030 million) in respect of a suit filed against the Bank for declaration, recovery of monies, release of securities, rendition of account and damages.| |
| |Based on legal advice and / or internal assessments, the management is confident that the above matters will be decided in the Bank's favour and accordingly no provision has been made in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.| |
|24.5|Commitments to extend credits| |
| |The Bank makes commitments to extend credit (including to related parties) in the normal course of its business but these being revocable commitments do not attract any significant penalty or expense if the facilities are unilaterally withdrawn except for Rs. 3,485.949 million (December 2023: Rs. 3,429.739 million) which are irrevocable in nature.| |

# 36 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect model are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of unquoted equity securities, other than investments in associates and subsidiaries, is determined on the basis of the break-up value of these investments as per their latest available financial statements. The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.

# 36.1 Fair value of financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

- Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Ijara Sukuk|Fair values of GoP Ijara Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Market Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.|
|Unlisted ordinary shares|Break-up value is determined on the basis of the NAV of the company using the latest available financial statements.|
|Sukuk Certificates|Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivative instruments|The Bank enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.|
|Mutual funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 3

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Property and equipment (land and buildings)|Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2022.|
|Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (NBAs)|NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the unconsolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023.|

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Bank which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Bank’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.

# 3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the financial statements of the Subsidiary Companies from the date from which control of the Subsidiary Companies by the Group commences until the date on which control ceases. The financial statements of the Subsidiary Companies are incorporated on a line-by-line basis and the investment held by the Bank is eliminated against the corresponding share capital and pre-acquisition reserve of the Subsidiary Companies in the consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements of the Subsidiary Companies are prepared for the same reporting period as the Holding Company, using accounting policies that are generally consistent with those of the Holding Company. Material intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

# 5.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

During the period, as directed by the SBP vide its BPRD Circular No. 07 of 2023 dated April 13, 2023, IFRS 9: ‘Financial Instruments' (the Standard) became applicable to the Bank. To ensure smooth and consistent implementation of the standard across banks, SBP had previously issued detailed instructions in BPRD Circular No. 03 of 2022 dated July 05, 2022.

The standard addresses recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets which requires recognition of impairment charge based on ‘expected credit losses' (ECL) approach rather than ‘incurred credit losses' approach as previously followed. The ECL has impact on all the assets of the Bank which are exposed to credit risk.

The Bank has adopted IFRS 9 in accordance with the Application Instructions from January 1, 2024, using the modified retrospective approach and has not restated comparatives for the 2023 reporting period and the differences in carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at January 1, 2024, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the Standard. Accordingly, the information presented for 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2024 under IFRS 9.

The accounting policies applicable to the 2023 presented information is consistent with the policies mentioned in the annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

SBP wide its BPRD Circular Letter No. 16 of 2024 dated July 29, 2024 have made certain amendments and extended timelines of application instructions for certain areas where the banking industry has sought more time. These amendments and relaxations include modification accounting for financial assets and liabilities as per the standard and recording and treatment of staff financing and other financings given at reduced rates with effect from October 1, 2024. Further, the banks have been asked to use existing practices of recordings of profit/return income using effective yield rate and ensure full recognition from October 1, 2024, this in turn also effects the reduced rate financing and modified assets accounting. Moreover, SBP have allowed an extension to Banks up to December 31, 2024 for developing the requisite models for calculating EAD for revolving products beyond the contractual date. In addition the banks have also been allowed to continue existing practice of valuing unquoted equity investment at their cost or breakup value, whichever is lower, till December 31, 2024 and perform fair valuation of these securities afterwards.

# 5.1.1 Impact on regulatory capital

In order to mitigate the impact of ECL models on capital, SBP has determined that it may be appropriate for the banks to introduce a transitional arrangement for the impact on regulatory capital from the application of ECL accounting. The transitional arrangement applies only to provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets. The transitional arrangement must adjust CET1 capital.

Had IFRS 9 not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 12 bps from 19.06% to 19.18%. The Group has applied the transitional arrangement on Regulatory Capital. Had the transitional arrangement not been applied then CAR would have been higher by 8 bps from 19.06% to 19.14%. In June 2024, ECL for Stage 1 and Stage 2 decreased due to which IFRS 9 transitional benefit has been compromised. The Group has applied the transitional arrangement on Regulatory Capital. Had the transitional arrangement not been applied than Leverage Ratio would have been lower by 17 bps from 4.96% to 4.79%.

# 5.1.2 Classification and measurement

Under the new standard, classification and measurement of financial assets depends on how these are managed based on business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Financial assets that do not meet the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criteria are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss regardless of the business model in which they are held.

# Recognition / derecognition and initial measurement

Trade receivable and debt securities issued are initially recorded when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction price.

The policy for derecognition of financial assets and liabilities are consistent with the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# Classification of Financial Assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Bank changes its business models for managing financial assets, in which cases all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following changes in the business model.

IFRS 9 allows entities to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces any 'accounting mismatch' that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different basis. SBP instructions state that banks may apply the fair value option if, in addition to the IFRS 9 criterion, (a) it is consistent with a documented risk management strategy, and (b) fair values are reliable at inception and throughout life of the instrument. Nonetheless, banks should avoid this option for financial instruments that are categorized as Level 3 in terms of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.

# Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortized cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value and all the fair value changes are recognized in profit and loss account. Financial liabilities classified at amortized cost are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured using the effective yield rate method. Profit expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit and loss. Any gain or loss on

# 5.1.3 Business model assessment

A financial asset is classified as either Held to collect, Held to collect and sale and Others based on Business model assessment. The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

The assessment considers the policies and objectives for the portfolio of financial assets, risk affecting, performance evaluation, historical sales information etc.

# 5.1.4 Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest / profit (SPPI)

The Bank assesses whether the contractual cash flows of a financial asset meet the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) criterion by examining the contractual terms. This includes checking for terms that could alter the amount and timings of cash flows, such as contingent events, leverage, or prepayment features, etc.

A prepayment feature aligns with SPPI if it mainly represents unpaid principal and profit, including reasonable compensation for early termination.

For fixed-rate financings with periodic profit rate resets, the Bank considers these SPPI-compliant as the revised rates reflect time value, credit risk, and other associated risks.

# 5.1.5 Subsequent measurement

The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets:

|Financial assets at FVTPL|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any profit / markup or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortised cost|These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective yield method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Profit and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.|
|Debt investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and is assessed for impairment under the new ECL model. Profit income is calculated using the effective yield method and includes amortization of premiums and accretion of discount and impairment are recognised in profit and loss account. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit and loss account.|
|Equity investments at FVOCI|These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are adjusted from the carrying value of investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit and loss account.|

# 5.1.6 Modification

Financial assets

The Bank renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of financing to its customers. If the cash flows are substantially different, the Bank derecognizes the original asset and recognizes a new financial asset at fair value, plus any eligible transaction costs.

If a financial asset measured at amortized cost or FVOCI is modified but not derecognized, the bank recalculates its gross carrying amount using the original effective yield rate, with the adjustment recognized as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss.

Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. If the new cash flows are significantly different, the bank derecognizes the old liability and recognizes a new one at fair value, with the difference between the old carrying amount and new fair value recorded in profit and loss.

# 5.1.7  Impairment

The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI (other than
equity instruments), lease receivables, and certain financing commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees) is
required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12
months (‘12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, a provision is required for ECL
resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’).
Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognized are in ‘Stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to
have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘Stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is
objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘Stage
3'. Under the SBP’s instructions, the Bank is not required to compute ECL on Government Securities and on
Government guaranteed credit exposure in local currency.

Based on the requirements of IFRS 9 and SBP's IFRS 9 application instructions, the Bank has performed an
ECL assessment considering the following key elements:

- PD: The probability that a counterparty will default over the next 12 months from the reporting date (12-
month ECL, Stage1) or over the lifetime of the product (lifetime ECL, Stage 2).
- EAD: The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, incorporating expectations on
drawdowns, amortization, pre-payments and forward-looking information where relevant.
- LGD: An estimate of the loss incurred on a facility upon default by a customer. LGD is calculated as
the difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the Bank expects to receive,
including from the liquidation of any form of collateral. It is expressed as a percentage of the exposure
outstanding on the date of classification of an obligor.

Under SBP's instructions, ECL of Stage 1 and Stage 2 is calculated as per IFRS 9, while ECL of Stage 3 has
been calculated based on higher of either the Prudential Regulations or IFRS 9 at borrower / facility level for
Corporate / Commercial / SME financing and at a segment / product basis for retail portfolio.

# 5.1.8  Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)

A SICR is assessed in the context of an increase in the risk of a default occurring over the life of the financial
instrument when compared to that expected at the time of initial recognition. It is not assessed in the context
of an increase in the ECL. The Bank used several qualitative and quantitative measures in assessing SICR.
Quantitative measures relate to deterioration of Obligor Risk Ratings (ORR) or where principal and / or profit
payments are 60 days or more past due. Qualitative factors include unavailability of financial information and
pending litigations.

A financial asset is transitioned to a backward stage in line with SBP instructions.

# 5.1.9  Governance, ownership and responsibilities

The Bank has adopted a governance framework requiring multiple functions to effectively work together to
ensure input from all business lines. The Risk Department defines the staging criteria for the new impairment
model and take ownership of all models, methodologies and the ECL calculation approach. Additionally, the
Risk department also take the ownership of the impact of ECL on bank's capital.

The Bank’s Finance Division performs ECL calculation. As a result, the department then assess the financial
impact, meet the financial reporting requirements and further monitor the impact on the financial ratios.

As per the Bank's policy, the Bank’s Internal Audit function carries out periodic review of IFRS 9 methodology
and impacts calculated by the Management.

# 25.3.2 Subsidiary Company - Faysal Asset Management Limited

(i) The income tax returns of the Subsidiary Company for the tax years 2004 to 2020 (financial year ended June 30, 2004 to December 31, 2019) have been filed and are deemed to have been assessed under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, unless selected by the taxation authorities for audit purposes. The Tax year 2005 (financial year ended June 30, 2005) has been selected by the taxation authorities for audit purpose. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 221 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 0.913 million for the tax year 2005 on account of apportionment of expenses and disallowance of certain expenses. The Subsidiary Company has paid Rs. 0.414 million and has filed an appeal against the order before the Commissioner Appeals, the proceedings of which are underway. The remaining tax liability on these matters is Rs. 0.498 million. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(ii) The income tax department has issued orders and show cause notices under section 221 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for recovery of Workers Welfare Fund (WWF) aggregating to Rs 0.818 million in respect of tax years 2008 and 2013. The details of orders and show cause along with the management actions are listed below:

|Tax years|Order / show cause references|Status|WWF Demand Rupees '000|
|---|---|---|---|
|2008|Order u/s 221 dated June 30, 2014|Appeal pending before the Commissioner Appeals|315|
|2013|Show cause u/s 221 dated May 7, 2014|Show cause notice has been responded to|503|
|Total|Total|Total|818|

The management is of the view that WWF was not applicable for tax year 2008. In tax year 2013, subsequent to clarification decision by the SHC, the management has not admitted WWF charge in the annual return of income. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(iii) The Punjab Revenue Authority issued show cause notice No.PRA/AM/61/2205/ dated March 12, 2014 to Faysal Asset Management Limited requiring the Subsidiary Company to obtain registration / enrolment and to pay sales tax amounting to Rs. 6.055 million from July 2013 to March 2014 under the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 with effect from May 22, 2013 on management fee earned in Punjab. In respect of this, the Subsidiary Company, jointly with other Asset Management Companies together with their respective collective investment schemes through their trustees, has filed a petition on July 8, 2014 in the SHC challenging the above notice. The Court has ordered suspension of the show cause notice till the next hearing of appeal in their order dated July 10, 2014. The next date of hearing has not yet been decided. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(iv) During the prior period, the audit of the tax year 2013 (financial year ended June 30, 2013) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 4.964 million for the tax year 2013 on account of apportionment of expenses, salary expenses and hardware and software expense. The management filed an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. The CIR(A) remanded back a few expenses while ordered against various other expenses.

for which the Subsidiary Company has decided to appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR). The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(v) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the audit of the tax year 2014 (financial year ended June 30, 2014) was completed by the taxation authorities. The tax authorities have passed an order under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whereby they have determined an additional liability of Rs. 2.673 million for the tax year 2014 on account of apportionment of expenses, time barred payables, expenses claimed on provisional basis, salary expenses, marketing and advertising expenses, brokerage and commission expenses, legal and professional charges and hardware and software expenses. The management had decided to file an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) [CIR(A)] on the grounds of disallowances made by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. During the current period the CIR(A) issued an order whereby the earlier order passed by the tax authorities under section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, has been annulled on the basis of being time barred, and consequentially the demand for additional liability has been relinquished. The management has decided to file an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) to contest the order passed by DCIR. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the decision in respect of these matters will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision for the above has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of this liability.

(vi) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIR) has passed an order under section 182(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 for the tax year 2018, whereby the DCIR has imposed a penalty of Rs. 0.833 million on account of non submission of statement required to be filed by the Subsidiary Company under bilateral or multilateral convention under section 165B of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. The management has filed an appeal before the CIR(A) on the subject matter and has paid an amount of Rs 0.083 million being 10% of the total amount of penalty imposed under the order and has thus obtained an automatic stay on the subject matter. The management of the Subsidiary Company is confident that the matter will be decided in the Subsidiary Company's favour and accordingly no provision in respect of this penalty has been made in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

| |The fair value of quoted securities other than those classified under held to collect model, is based on quoted market price.

| |The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term loans, other assets, other liabilities, fixed term deposits and borrowings cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for these assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments.| | | | |
|37.1|Fair value of financial assets| | | | |
| |The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:| | | | |

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within level 2

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Ijara Sukuk|Fair values of GoP Ijara Sukuk are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Market Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of quotes received from different pre-defined / approved dealers / brokers.|
|Unlisted ordinary shares|Break-up value is determined on the basis of the NAV of the company using the latest available financial statements.|
|Sukuk Certificates|Fair values of Sukuk certificates are determined using the MUFAP or PSX rates.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts|The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mark-to-market currency rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.|
|Derivative instruments|The Holding Company enters into derivative contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.|
|Mutual funds|Units of mutual funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP).|

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair valuation of financial instruments within level 3

|Item|Valuation approach and input used|
|---|---|
|Property and equipment (land and buildings)|Land and buildings are revalued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2022.|
|Non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims (NBAs)|NBAs are valued by professionally qualified valuers as per the accounting policy disclosed in the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023.|

The valuations, mentioned above, are conducted by the valuation experts appointed by the Holding Company which are also on the panel of the Pakistan Banks' Association (PBA). The valuation experts use a market based approach to arrive at the fair value of the Holding Company’s properties. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable or similar properties. These values are adjusted to reflect the current condition of the properties. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty, accordingly a quantitative disclosure of sensitivity has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
