# Macroeconomic Review

With a 2.5% GDP growth in FY’24, Pakistan’s nascent economic recovery continues, underpinned by favourable global commodity prices, improved fiscal discipline and a more stable external position. The Large-Scale Manufacturing Index is regaining footing, with the Jul’24 reading exhibiting a growth of 2.4%. High frequency sales indicators and increased capacity utilization also reflect a moderate pickup in industrial activity. Inflation of 9.6% for Aug’24 was the first single digit reading since Oct’21 and dropped further to a 44-month low of 6.9% in Sep’24. This deceleration has been supported by a favourable base effect, along with soft food and energy prices. Average inflation fell from 29.0% in Q1FY’24 to 9.2% in Q1FY’25 with the trajectory potentially heading below SBP’s FY’25 forecast of 11.5%–13.5%.

The trade deficit for 2MFY’25 grew by 21.7% to $ 4.7 billion. Exports increased by 7.2% while imports grew by 13.8% YoY. Notably, machinery imports increased by over 60%, pointing to a revival of capacity installation, while food exports grew 35.5% due to robust agricultural growth. Strong remittance growth continued in FY’25, with average monthly flows just shy of $ 3.0 billion. Remittances of $ 8.8 billion for Q1FY’25 were 38.8% higher YoY, a stark contrast to the decline of 19.8% in Q1FY’24. Consequently, the Current Account Deficit for 2MFY’25 fell by 81%, to $ 0.2 billion.

The securing of additional government and commercial financing from GCC countries, led to the much-awaited IMF Board approval for the $ 7 billion, 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Key priorities under the program are i) strengthening the fiscal framework, including the alignment of federal and provincial tax measures ii) a more equitable tax regime to increase the tax/GDP ratio iii) energy sector viability through cost-side reforms iv) accelerating privatization & SOE reforms and v) building climate resilience. The SBP continued to build shock absorbers and, with the immediate disbursement of the first $ 1.0 billion EFF tranche in Sep’24, FX reserves reached $ 10.7 billion, a 30-month high. The improving external position has resulted in a steady strengthening of the Rupee, which appreciated by 1.5% in 9M’24 to Rs 277.7/$.

In July, subsequent to the IMF Staff Level Agreement, Fitch upgraded Pakistan’s sovereign rating to CCC+ returning it to the level in Feb’23. The agency cited improved access to external financing, traction on reform implementation and better FX buffers. In August, Moody’s followed suit, raising the country’s rating from Caa3 to Caa2, while improving the Outlook from Stable to Positive. Taken together, the upgrades reflect a growing international confidence in Pakistan’s ability to manage financial challenges and creating a pathway for sustainable growth. Pakistan is now better positioned to access international markets on more favourable terms, paving the way for a potential Eurobond or Panda bond issue.

The equity bull run that started at the end of Q3’23 continues, with the market outperforming all expectations and setting new records. After a brief stutter in Q3’24 – driven by earlier delays in the EFF approval, political noise, and foreign outflows caused by FTSE rebalancing – the index has regained momentum, continuing its upward march and recently hitting an all-time high of 86K, a 38.5% increase over Dec’23.

Rapid monetary easing continued with cuts of 100bps and 200bps in the Policy Rate in Jul’24 and Sep’24 to 17.5% on the back of the sharp decline in inflation. The MPC noted a number of favourable developments such as declining oil prices, rising FX reserves and improving business confidence and assessed that the real interest rate was sufficiently positive to continue dampening inflation. Industry advances as of Aug’24 showed a decline of 4.4% from Dec’23 in line with the 3.5% drop in private sector credit, while deposits increased by 10.6% over the same period. Banking spreads decreased by 30bps in 8MCY24 compared to the same period last year.

# Financial Performance

HBL has delivered a consolidated profit before tax of Rs 85.9 billion for the first nine months of 2024, 3% higher than in the corresponding period of last year. All domestic businesses continued to perform strongly, coupled with sustained improvements in the international franchise. Profit after tax rose to Rs 43.3 billion, while the Bank’s earnings per share improved to Rs 30.03 in 9M’24.

HBL’s balance sheet grew by 12% over Dec’23 to Rs 6.2 trillion. Domestic deposits increased by 18% to Rs 4.1 trillion, primarily led by low-cost deposits which grew by Rs 422 billion over Dec’23; this drove an improvement in the CASA mix from 85.8% in Dec’23 to 87.3% in Sep’24. International deposits grew by 11% to over US$ 2 billion, with HBL’s total deposits increasing to Rs 4.8 trillion. With market rates falling rapidly, there has been a turnaround in lending activity; domestic advances increased by 3.9% during the quarter with all businesses registering growth. With a revival of international lending, HBL’s total advances rose to Rs 1.8 trillion.

The average domestic balance sheet for 9M’24 grew by 18% over 9M’23 as average domestic deposits increased by Rs 639 billion. With the turning of the rate cycle, spreads compressed by 60bps. Nevertheless, the volumetric growth led to a 5% rise in domestic net interest income and was complemented by international balance sheet expansion with interest.
---
income growing by 12%. The Bank’s total net interest income for 9M’24 thus increased to Rs 185.3 billion. Non-fund income performance was strong, with an increase of nearly 60% to Rs 60.7 billion. This was led by fees, which grew 20% to Rs 36.6 billion. HBL’s Cards business continued its stellar results, contributing 43% of the fee growth, with branch fees, remittances and Bancassurance boosting total fee income. Consequently, HBL’s total revenue increased by 14% to Rs 246.0 billion.

High inflation in the first half of 2024 has increased administrative expenses by 13% to Rs 139.0 billion. However, HBL’s focus on cost optimization has helped contain expenses during the quarter; the cost-to-income ratio continued to fall, reducing from 56.7% in Q2’24 to 55.6% for Q3’24. Higher non-performing loans induced an uptick in the infection ratio over the previous quarter, to 6.0%, but prudent provisioning has resulted in the specific coverage remaining above 90%; the total coverage remains above 100%.

# Capital Ratios

Internal capital generated by the strong results have strengthened HBL’s capital ratios during 2024, while also enabling a better dividend payout. The Consolidated Tier 1 CAR increased from 12.44% in Dec’23 to 12.55% in Sep’24. During the last quarter, the SBP, as part of its annual review, revised the Bank’s D-SIB capital buffer to 1.0%. This increased the CET1 headroom over minimum requirements, resulting in a higher eligibility of Tier II capital. The total CAR further increased from 16.01% to 16.39% over the same period.

## Chunk 7


# Credit Ratings

During the quarter, the Bank’s credit ratings were upgraded by Moodys following its rating upgrade of the sovereign. HBL’s long-term deposit rating was raised from Caa3 to Caa2, while the Baseline Credit Assessment was improved from caa3 to caa2. The Outlook on the Bank’s long-term deposit ratings has been changed from Stable to Positive.

Capital Intelligence Ratings (CI), another international ratings agency, also affirmed HBL’s long-term and short-term foreign currency ratings at ‘C+’ and ‘C’, respectively. At the same time, CI has affirmed HBL’s Bank Standalone Rating of ‘c’ and Core Financial Strength rating of ‘b+’. The Outlook for all ratings is Stable.

# Dividend

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on October 16, 2024, has declared an interim cash dividend of Rs 4.00 per share (40%) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

## Chunk 8


# Future Outlook

Following two years of uncertainty, the EFF is a material boost to Pakistan’s external stability. This is reflected through rating upgrades as well as declining Eurobond yields. An improved ability to raise additional financing, alongside fiscal consolidation and better liquidity management bodes well for future debt sustainability. SBP recently initiated buyback auctions on behalf

of the federal government to improve the maturity profile of its domestic debt. Dollar liquidity is expected to improve through elevated remittance flows; additional inflows from the EFF and bilateral creditors should allow for further accumulation of reserves, which are expected to increase to $ 13.5 billion by Jun’25.

GDP growth in FY’25 is likely to remain at the lower end of SBP’s 2.5-3.5% forecast as the outlook for the agriculture sector has weakened. Wheat prices remain soft and a shortfall is expected in the cotton crop with a reduced area under cultivation. Industrial growth is expected to recover but will remain below potential, with headwinds from higher energy costs and subdued demand, although lower interest rates will provide some respite. The inflation outlook is benign, but upside risks persist with the potential for a Middle East conflict driven spike in oil prices.

It is therefore critical for the Government to stay on course with the EFF. Structural reform targets are likely to be monitored much more stringently and given Pakistan’s track record of IMF programs, slippages are less likely to be condoned. In particular, the key areas of energy, taxation and privatization must be pursued with rigour and vigour. While initial efforts on improving tax administration are encouraging, the tax burden is unfair and inequitable and over-skewed towards existing taxpayers. Simultaneously, much tougher action needs to be taken against non-filers in order to make a meaningful improvement in the tax base and increase the Tax/GDP ratio. While the Government has committed to stop any net flow into the circular debt, cost-side reforms will be equally critical in reducing the stock. This is Pakistan’s best opportunity in many years to launch itself on a sustainable growth trajectory and an opportunity that must not be squandered.

HBL’s results continue on an upward trajectory even in a challenging environment. We remain steadfast in our objectives of financial inclusion, sustainability and capacity building. Our commitment to fostering innovation is evident through our strategic partnership with P@SHA – together we have which has nurtured local IT talent and also provided a global platform for Pakistani IT companies to showcase their capabilities. The Bank recently held the third round of its sponsorship of She’s Next, its collaborative program with Visa aimed at providing mentorship to women entrepreneurs. Our digitalization agenda is delivering growing volumes across all businesses; more than 3.5 million active users of HBL’s Mobile and Internet Banking transacted more than Rs 5.5 billion in the 9 months of 2024, while 71% of our Rs 13.7 trillion throughput in cash management is now processed digitally. Our market leading POS network continues to widen and processed nearly Rs 320 billion so far this year, more than one-third of Pakistan’s total POS throughput.

HBL’s efforts continue to receive independent recognition from local and international organisations across all areas of our operations – from fire safety to investment banking. This quarter, we received two awards locally, that have particular significance for us. The Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance ranked HBL’s Board of Directors as the best in the country – across all industries – underlining our commitment to exceptional standards of governance. The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry awarded us the Best Conventional Bank in Pakistan – a testament to our relentless focus on contributing to Pakistan’s economic growth and development.

# 2.3

New standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current year

As directed by the SBP via BPRD Circular letter no. 7 of 2023, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is effective in Pakistan for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 1, 2018. The requirements of this standard are already incorporated in the Group’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The results of those overseas operations where IFRS 9 is not applicable will be directly incorporated in the Group’s financial statements as per the respective host country's regulations, for the year ending December 31, 2024. The results of associated companies of the Bank, operating in Pakistan, to which IFRS 9 does not apply, will be directly incorporated in the Group’s financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024. The results of overseas associates will be incorporated in the Group’s financial statements as per the respective host country’s regulations till the adoption of IFRS 9 in those jurisdictions.

The SBP, via BPRD Circular letter no. 16 of 2024, has extended the timeline for compliance with the following requirements of IFRS 9 to accounting periods beginning October 01, 2024:

- a- Recognition of interest income/ expense under the effective interest rate method;
- b- Measurement of staff loans at fair value;
- c- Accounting for modified loans.

Additionally, the same circular allows banks to continue measuring unlisted equity securities at the lower of cost or breakup value up to December 31, 2024.

Except for the implementation of IFRS 9 in Pakistan, as discussed in note 3.1, the Bank expects that amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards will not affect its financial statements in the period of initial application.

# 3.1.1

Classification of Financial Assets

The Group classifies its financial assets, other than its investments in subsidiaries and associates, into the following categories:

- - at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
- - at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)
- - at Amortised Cost

Classification of Equity instruments

Equity securities that are traded in an active market and are held for trading purposes will be classified as FVTPL. Equity securities that are not held for trading purposes will be classified as FVOCI; however, gains and losses realised on disposal of securities classified as FVOCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account. The classification decision is made on a case by case basis at the time of purchase, is documented, and is irrevocable.

## Chunk 31


# Classification of other Financial Assets

Financial Assets other than equity will be classified based on their cash flow characteristics and business model assessment:

- Amortised Cost: These will be classified as amortised cost if the objective is to hold the asset only for collecting contractual cash flows (principal and interest).
- FVOCI: These will be classified at FVOCI when the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (principal and interest) and also to potentially sell the same depending on market conditions. Any unrealized profit or loss on debt instruments classified as FVOCI is reflected in other comprehensive income and is recycled through the profit and loss account when the investment is sold.
- FVTPL: This includes financial assets:
- a. which do not have a fixed maturity; or
- b. which are not classified as either at amortised cost or at FVOCI.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Subsequent Measurement

# Equity and debt securities classified as FVTPL

These securities, other than unlisted equity securities, are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are taken to the profit and loss account.

Changes in the value of unlisted equity securities, carried at the lower of cost or breakup value, are taken to the profit and loss account.

## Chunk 33


# Equity and debt securities classified as FVOCI

These securities, other than unlisted equity securities, are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in OCI. When a debt security is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account. When an equity security is derecognised, gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings.

Changes in the value of unlisted equity securities, carried out at the lower of cost or breakup value, are recorded in OCI. When these are derecognised, gains and losses are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings.

# Other financial assets classified at amortised cost

Other financial assets initially classified at amortised cost continue to be subsequently measured at amortised cost.

## Chunk 34


# 3.1.2 Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified at FVTPL, when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value.

Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

## Chunk 35


# 3.1.3 Impairment

An ECL provision will be calculated on financial assets designated at FVOCI or at Amortised cost in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 and the guidelines issued by the SBP. Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of the ECL Framework.

Equity securities are not subject to impairment.

## Chunk 36


# 3.1.4 Transitional Impact

The Bank has elected to follow the modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. comparative figures have not been restated on the initial application of IFRS 9. Instead, the cumulative impact has been recorded as an adjustment to equity as of January 01, 2024. Accordingly, the information presented as of December 31, 2023 and for the period ended June 30, 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9.

# 3.2 Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the ECL allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purpose of measuring ECL;
- Establishing the number and relative weightages of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios for each segment; and
- Determining whether an asset shows a significant increase in credit risk.

| |The fair values of traded investments are based on quoted market prices.| |
| |The fair value of unquoted debt securities, fixed term advances, fixed term deposits and borrowings, other assets and other liabilities, cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability due to the absence of a current and active market for such assets and liabilities and reliable data regarding market rates for similar instruments and therefore, are not reported as part of this disclosure.| |
| |In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.| |
| |All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:| |
| |Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.| |
| |Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the assets or liabilities either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).| |
| |Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.| |

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3

Federal Government securities The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.

Non-Government debt securities Non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.

Foreign Government debt securities The fair values of foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg/ Reuters.

Units of mutual funds The fair values of units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.

Derivatives The Group enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.

Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.

Property and equipment and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity, required for Level 3 assets, has not been presented in these condensed interim consolidated financial statements.

# RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Group has related party relationships with various parties including its Directors, Key Management Personnel, Group entities, associated companies and employee benefit schemes of the Group.

Transactions with related parties, other than those under the terms of employment, are executed on an arm's length basis i.e. do not involve more than normal risk and are substantially on the same terms, including mark-up rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated parties.

Contributions to and accruals in respect of staff retirement and other benefit schemes are made in accordance with the actuarial valuations / terms of the schemes.

37.1 During the period, the SBP through its letter No. BSD-2/Bank/HBL/749858/2024 dated August 29, 2024, has reduced the D-SIB buffer from 1.50% to 1.00%.

37.2 The SBP has permitted banks to adopt a transitional approach to phase in the initial impact of the ECL for stage 1 and 2 financial assets over a period of five years. Had there been no such relaxation, the Group's total CAR would have been lower by 71 bps.

# Macroeconomic Review

With a 2.5% GDP growth in FY’24, Pakistan’s nascent economic recovery continues, underpinned by favourable global commodity prices, improved fiscal discipline and a more stable external position. The Large-Scale Manufacturing Index is regaining footing, with the Jul’24 reading exhibiting a growth of 2.4%. High frequency sales indicators and increased capacity utilization also reflect a moderate pickup in industrial activity. Inflation of 9.6% for Aug’24 was the first single digit reading since Oct’21 and dropped further to a 44-month low of 6.9% in Sep’24. This deceleration has been supported by a favourable base effect, along with soft food and energy prices. Average inflation fell from 29.0% in Q1FY’24 to 9.2% in Q1FY’25 with the trajectory potentially heading below SBP’s FY’25 forecast of 11.5%–13.5%.

The trade deficit for 2MFY’25 grew by 21.7% to $ 4.7 billion. Exports increased by 7.2% while imports grew by 13.8% YoY. Notably, machinery imports increased by over 60%, pointing to a revival of capacity installation, while food exports grew 35.5% due to robust agricultural growth. Strong remittance growth continued in FY’25, with average monthly flows just shy of $ 3.0 billion. Remittances of $ 8.8 billion for Q1FY’25 were 38.8% higher YoY, a stark contrast to the decline of 19.8% in Q1FY’24. Consequently, the Current Account Deficit for 2MFY’25 fell by 81%, to $ 0.2 billion.

The securing of additional government and commercial financing from GCC countries, led to the much-awaited IMF Board approval for the $ 7 billion, 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Key priorities under the program are i) strengthening the fiscal framework, including the alignment of federal and provincial tax measures ii) a more equitable tax regime to increase the tax/GDP ratio iii) energy sector viability through cost-side reforms iv) accelerating privatization & SOE reforms and v) building climate resilience. The SBP continued to build shock absorbers and, with the immediate disbursement of the first $ 1.0 billion EFF tranche in Sep’24, FX reserves reached $ 10.7 billion, a 30-month high. The improving external position has resulted in a steady strengthening of the Rupee, which appreciated by 1.5% in 9M’24 to Rs 277.7/$.

In July, subsequent to the IMF Staff Level Agreement, Fitch upgraded Pakistan’s sovereign rating to CCC+ returning it to the level in Feb’23. The agency cited improved access to external financing, traction on reform implementation and better FX buffers. In August, Moody’s followed suit, raising the country’s rating from Caa3 to Caa2, while improving the Outlook from Stable to Positive. Taken together, the upgrades reflect a growing international confidence in Pakistan’s ability to manage financial challenges and creating a pathway for sustainable growth. Pakistan is now better positioned to access international markets on more favourable terms, paving the way for a potential Eurobond or Panda bond issue.

The equity bull run that started at the end of Q3’23 continues, with the market outperforming all expectations and setting new records. After a brief stutter in Q3’24 – driven by earlier delays in the EFF approval, political noise, and foreign outflows caused by FTSE rebalancing – the index has regained momentum, continuing its upward march and recently hitting an all-time high of 86K, a 38.5% increase over Dec’23.

Rapid monetary easing continued with cuts of 100bps and 200bps in the Policy Rate in Jul’24 and Sep’24 to 17.5% on the back of the sharp decline in inflation. The MPC noted a number of favourable developments such as declining oil prices, rising FX reserves and improving business confidence and assessed that the real interest rate was sufficiently positive to continue dampening inflation. Industry advances as of Aug’24 showed a decline of 4.4% from Dec’23 in line with the 3.5% drop in private sector credit, while deposits increased by 10.6% over the same period. Banking spreads decreased by 30bps in 8MCY24 compared to the same period last year.

# Financial Performance

HBL has delivered an unconsolidated profit before tax of Rs 86.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024, 4% higher than in the corresponding period of last year. All domestic businesses continued to perform strongly, coupled with sustained improvements in the international franchise. Profit after tax rose to Rs 43.4 billion.

HBL’s balance sheet grew by 12% over Dec’23 to Rs 5.8 trillion. Domestic deposits increased by 18% to Rs 4.1 trillion, primarily led by low-cost deposits which grew by Rs 422 billion over Dec’23; this drove an improvement in the CASA mix from 85.8% in Dec’23 to 87.3% in Sep’24. International deposits grew by 10% to US$ 1.6 billion, with HBL’s total deposits increasing to Rs 4.5 trillion. With market rates falling rapidly, there has been a turnaround in lending activity; domestic advances increased by 3.9% during the quarter with all businesses registering growth. With a revival of international lending, HBL’s total advances rose to Rs 1.7 trillion.

The average domestic balance sheet for 9M’24 grew by 18% over 9M’23 as average domestic deposits increased by Rs 639 billion. With the turning of the rate cycle, spreads compressed by 60bps. Nevertheless, the volumetric growth led to a 5% rise in domestic net interest income and was complemented by international balance sheet expansion with interest income growing by 14.7%. The Bank’s total net interest income for 9M’24 thus increased to Rs 173.2 billion. Non-fund income

# Quarterly Report | September 2024

Performance was strong, with an increase of 43% to Rs 53.2 billion. This was led by fees, which grew 19% to Rs 32.0 billion. HBL’s Cards business continued its stellar results, contributing 49% of the fee growth, with branch fees, remittances and Bancassurance boosting total fee income. Consequently, HBL’s total revenue increased by 12% to Rs 226.5 billion.

High inflation in the first half of 2024 has increased administrative expenses by 12% to Rs 124.0 billion. However, HBL’s focus on cost optimization has helped contain expenses during the quarter; the cost-to-income ratio continued to fall, reducing from 54.8% in Q2’24 to 53.4% for Q3’24. Higher non-performing loans induced an uptick in the infection ratio over the previous quarter, to 5.9%, but prudent provisioning has resulted in the specific coverage remaining above 92%; the total coverage remains above 100%.

# Capital Ratios

Internal capital generated by the strong results have strengthened HBL’s capital ratios during 2024, while also enabling a better dividend payout. The Unconsolidated Tier 1 CAR increased from 13.44% in Dec’23 to 13.75% in Sep’24. During the last quarter, the SBP, as part of its annual review, revised the Bank’s D-SIB capital buffer to 1.0%. This increased the CET1 headroom over minimum requirements, resulting in a higher eligibility of Tier II capital. The total CAR further increased from 17.28% to 18.16% over the same period.

# Credit Ratings

During the quarter, the Bank’s credit ratings were upgraded by Moodys following its rating upgrade of the sovereign. HBL’s long-term deposit rating was raised from Caa3 to Caa2, while the Baseline Credit Assessment was improved from caa3 to caa2. The Outlook on the Bank’s long-term deposit ratings has been changed from Stable to Positive.

Capital Intelligence Ratings (CI), another international ratings agency, also affirmed HBL’s long-term and short-term foreign currency ratings at ‘C+’ and ‘C’, respectively. At the same time, CI has affirmed HBL’s Bank Standalone Rating of ‘c’ and Core Financial Strength rating of ‘b+’. The Outlook for all ratings is Stable.

# Dividend

The Board of Directors, in its meeting held on October 16, 2024, has declared an interim cash dividend of Rs 4.00 per share (40%) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

# Future Outlook

Following two years of uncertainty, the EFF is a material boost to Pakistan’s external stability. This is reflected through rating upgrades as well as declining Eurobond yields. An improved ability to raise additional financing, alongside fiscal consolidation and better liquidity management bodes well for future debt sustainability. SBP recently initiated buyback auctions on behalf of the federal government to improve the maturity profile of its domestic debt. Dollar liquidity is expected to improve through elevated remittance flows; additional inflows from the EFF and bilateral creditors should allow for further accumulation of reserves, which are expected to increase to $ 13.5 billion by Jun’25.

## Chunk 120


# GDP Growth Outlook

GDP growth in FY’25 is likely to remain at the lower end of SBP’s 2.5-3.5% forecast as the outlook for the agriculture sector has weakened. Wheat prices remain soft and a shortfall is expected in the cotton crop with a reduced area under cultivation. Industrial growth is expected to recover but will remain below potential, with headwinds from higher energy costs and subdued demand, although lower interest rates will provide some respite. The inflation outlook is benign, but upside risks persist with the potential for a Middle East conflict driven spike in oil prices.

It is therefore critical for the Government to stay on course with the EFF. Structural reform targets are likely to be monitored much more stringently and given Pakistan’s track record of IMF programs, slippages are less likely to be condoned. In particular, the key areas of energy, taxation and privatization must be pursued with rigour and vigour. While initial efforts on improving tax administration are encouraging, the tax burden is unfair and inequitable and over-skewed towards existing taxpayers. Simultaneously, much tougher action needs to be taken against non-filers in order to make a meaningful improvement in the tax base and increase the Tax/GDP ratio. While the Government has committed to stop any net flow into the circular debt, cost-side reforms will be equally critical in reducing the stock. This is Pakistan’s best opportunity in many years to launch itself on a sustainable growth trajectory and an opportunity that must not be squandered.

# HBL Performance

HBL’s results continue on an upward trajectory even in a challenging environment. We remain steadfast in our objectives of financial inclusion, sustainability and capacity building. Our commitment to fostering innovation is evident through our strategic partnership with P@SHA – together we have nurtured local IT talent and also provided a global platform for Pakistani IT companies to showcase their capabilities. The Bank recently held the third round of its sponsorship of She’s Next, its collaborative program with Visa aimed at providing mentorship to women entrepreneurs. Our digitalization agenda is delivering growing volumes across all businesses; more than 3.5 million active users of HBL’s Mobile and Internet Banking transacted more than Rs 5.5 billion in the 9 months of 2024, while 71% of our Rs 13.7 trillion throughput in cash management is now processed digitally. Our market leading POS network continues to widen and processed nearly Rs 320 billion so far this year, more than one-third of Pakistan’s total POS throughput.

# Awards and Recognition

HBL’s efforts continue to receive independent recognition from local and international organisations across all areas of our operations – from fire safety to investment banking. This quarter, we received two awards locally, that have particular significance for us. The Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance ranked HBL’s Board of Directors as the best in the country – across all industries – underlining our commitment to exceptional standards of governance. The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry awarded us the Best Conventional Bank in Pakistan – a testament to our relentless focus on contributing to Pakistan’s economic growth and development.

# Appreciation and Acknowledgement

On behalf of the Board and management, we would like to place on record our appreciation for the efforts of our regulators and the Government of Pakistan, in particular the State Bank of Pakistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. In these challenging times, they have stepped up with policies and measures that are prudent, proactive and balanced, protecting the economy, customers and people of Pakistan, while also safeguarding the integrity and soundness of the banking and financial services industry.

We are indebted to our customers, many of whom have banked with us for generations, and who continue to entrust us with their business and confidence. Our shareholders have provided steadfast support and to them, and to all our stakeholders, we are deeply grateful. The Board and the management remain committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance and we assure our stakeholders that we will be industry leaders in this area.

Lastly, but certainly not the least, we express our deepest appreciation and gratitude to our employees and their families, especially in customer facing units and branches, who continually go the extra mile, even at personal cost, to ensure that our customers are able to meet their critical needs. They are our heroes and heroines and we salute them for their dedication and tireless efforts.

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

# 2.3 New standards and amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards that have become effective in the current year

As directed by the SBP via BPRD Circular letter no. 7 of 2023, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is effective in Pakistan for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. IFRS 9 has been applicable in several overseas jurisdictions at various effective dates starting from January 1, 2018. The requirements of this standard are already incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements for the jurisdictions where IFRS 9 has been adopted. The results of those overseas operations where IFRS 9 is not applicable will be directly incorporated in the Bank’s financial statements as per the respective host country's regulations, for the year ending December 31, 2024.

The SBP, via BPRD Circular letter no.16 of 2024, has extended the timeline for compliance with the following requirements of IFRS 9 to accounting periods beginning October 01, 2024:

- a- Recognition of interest income / expense under the effective interest rate method;
- b- Measurement of staff loans at fair value;
- c- Accounting for modified loans.

Additionally, the same circular allows banks to continue measuring unlisted equity securities at the lower of cost or breakup value up to December 31, 2024.

Except for the implementation of IFRS 9 in Pakistan, as discussed in note 3.1, the Bank expects that amendments to existing accounting and reporting standards will not affect its financial statements in the period of initial application.

# 3.1.1 Classification of Financial Assets

The Bank classifies its financial assets, other than its investments in subsidiaries and associates, into the following categories:

- - at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL);
- - at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI);
- - at Amortised Cost.

## Chunk 143


# Classification of Equity Instruments

Equity securities that are traded in an active market and are held for trading purposes will be classified as FVTPL. Equity securities that are not held for trading purposes will be classified as FVOCI; however, gains and losses realised on disposal of securities classified as FVOCI will not be recycled through the profit and loss account. The classification decision is made on a case by case basis at the time of purchase, is documented, and is irrevocable.

## Chunk 144


# Classification of other Financial Assets

Financial Assets other than equity will be classified based on their cash flow characteristics and business model assessment:

- - Amortised Cost: These will be classified as amortised cost if the objective is to hold the asset only for collecting contractual cash flows (principal and interest).

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024

- FVOCI: These will be classified at FVOCI when the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (principal and interest) and also to potentially sell the same depending on market conditions. Any unrealized profit or loss on debt instruments classified as FVOCI is reflected in other comprehensive income and is recycled through the profit and loss account when the investment is sold.
- FVTPL: This includes financial assets:
- a. which do not have fixed maturity; or
- b. which are not classified as either at amortised cost or at FVOCI.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

# Subsequent Measurement

# Equity and debt securities classified as FVTPL

These securities, other than unlisted equity securities, are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are taken to the profit and loss account. Changes in the value of unlisted equity securities, carried at lower of cost or breakup value are taken to the profit and loss account.

## Chunk 147


# Equity and debt securities classified as FVOCI

These securities, other than unlisted equity securities, are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in OCI. When a debt security is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account. When an equity security is derecognised, gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings. Changes in the value of unlisted equity securities, carried out at lower of cost or breakup value, are recorded in OCI. When these are derecognised, gains and losses are not recycled through the profit and loss account but are transferred directly to retained earnings.

# Other financial assets classified at amortised cost

Other financial assets initially classified at amortised cost continue to be subsequently measured at amortised cost.

## Chunk 148


# 3.1.2 Classification of Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are either classified at FVTPL, when they are held for trading purposes, or at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities classified at amortised cost are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.

## Chunk 149


# 3.1.3 Impairment

An ECL provision will be calculated on financial assets designated at FVOCI or at Amortised cost in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 and the guidelines issued by the SBP. Credit exposures (in local currency) that have been guaranteed by the Government and Government Securities are exempted from the application of the ECL Framework. Equity securities are not subject to impairment.

## Chunk 150


# 3.1.4 Transitional Impact

The Bank has elected to follow the modified retrospective approach for restatement i.e. comparative figures have not been restated on the initial application of IFRS 9. Instead, the cumulative impact has been recorded as an adjustment to equity as of January 01, 2024. Accordingly, the information presented as of December 31, 2023 and for the period ended September 30, 2023 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS-9.

# 3.2 Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the ECL allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

- Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;
- Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purpose of measuring ECL;
- Establishing the number and relative weightages of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios for each segment; and
- Determining whether an asset shows a significant increase in credit risk.

# NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

# FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since they are either short-term in nature or, in the case of customer advances, deposits and certain long term borrowings, are frequently repriced.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements are categorised within the following fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

- Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

# Valuation techniques used in determination of fair values within Level 2 and Level 3

|Federal Government securities|The fair values of Federal Government securities are determined on the basis of rates / prices sourced from Reuters.|
|---|---|
|Non-Government debt securities|Non-Government debt securities denominated in Rupees are valued on the basis of rates announced by the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP). Non-Government debt securities denominated in other currencies are valued on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.|
|Foreign Government debt securities|The fair values of Foreign Government debt securities are determined on the basis of rates taken from Bloomberg / Reuters.|
|Units of mutual funds|The fair values of investments in units of mutual funds are determined based on their net asset values as published at the close of each business day.|
|Derivatives|The Bank enters into derivatives contracts with various counterparties. Derivatives that are valued using valuation techniques based on market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations.|
|Forward foreign exchange contracts and Forward Government securities transactions|The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and forward Government securities transactions are determined using forward pricing calculations.|
|Property and non-banking assets|Land, buildings and non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims are revalued on a periodic basis using professional valuers. The valuation is based on their assessment of the market value of the assets. The effect of changes in the unobservable inputs used in the valuations cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, a qualitative disclosure of sensitivity, required for Level 3 assets, has not been presented in these condensed interim unconsolidated financial statements.|
